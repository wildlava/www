<p>The clouds covered up the sun for a while, but that was a good thing,
since it was July and could have been unbearably hot outside sitting in
the sun.
<p>Joe and I walked down the aisle together. He really looked good! My
attendants and the groomsmen had entered the ceremony area from the sides.
Joe's parents had walked up the aisle together, then my parents, then us.

<td>Anthony opened the ceremony by saying he was thankful he didn't have
to perform the ceremony by jumping out of a plane. That broke everyone
up and seemed to set a lighter mood, which was great. I don't really remember
what else he said, or the order of it, but it was beautiful.&nbsp; We lit
a unity candle, which I really didn't want to do because I was afraid the
light would go out (it didn't), and we lit candles to represent people
who were not there physically, but there in spirit.</td>

what she said!</center>

so I wasn't sure what to expect. He was funny too! Now I wish we had spent
the extra $$$ on videography! Oh well.</td>

<td>I held onto my bouquet until it was time for the vows and the ring.
Laurie had been standing on the end holding the ring I was to give to Joe,
and it passed down the line so that my friends and my sister, representing
all my friends and family, had to touch it. I got the ring from Erin and
spoke my vows.&nbsp; I even looked right into Joe's eyes once or twice
and didn't break down! I was doing good!&nbsp;
<p>Then Joe got the ring and said his vows-without looking at any paper!!
Boy, was I surprised! And fighting back tears? Yeah, he really gets to
me. When he put the ring on my finger, he took a deep breath and said "Now
I'm done!" and everyone burst out laughing! At some point Anthony told
us we could kiss, which we did, then we walked down the aisle to the theme
song from "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" soundtrack.
