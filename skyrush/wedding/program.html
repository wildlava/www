<td><font size=+0><b>The Bride</b> - Joanne is known as the computer/e-mail
goddess in her office, which she is leaving for a 3 month honeymoon. She
has a background in theatre and dance, and loves being outdoors. She and
her sister agree she would have been a great flower child in the 60's.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>The Groom</b> - Joe is into 3D computer graphics, the
Internet, creative writing (for fun, of course!), and many outdoor activities.
Joe met Joanne at the drop zone, where they both spent much of their free
time jumping out of airplanes. They also "dove" into SCUBA together a few
years ago. He's joining Joanne in their three month low-tech USA tour (but
of course they'll have a laptop for e-mail!).</font>

awesome mom, she is now a new nurse!</font>
<p><font size=+0>Allison Lynch -Another close friend for a long time, occupational
therapist, and bigtime hiker, she will hold the flowers.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Laurie Vasily - Yet another of Joanne's longtime friends,
former Peace Corps member, and Ph. D contender at Joe's alma mater (Cornell),
she will carry the ring.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Erin Burke - Joanne's l'il sis, and rockin' L.A. woman,
she will hand the ring to Joanne to give to Joe.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Maria Hecht - Cousin and South End neighbor, Maria did
the invitations (thanks Maria!).&nbsp;</font></blockquote>

<b><font size=+0>The Honeymoon</font></b>
<p><font size=+0>Joanne and Joe decided to take a three month hiatus from
their jobs and everyday life and trek across the country in Joe's beloved
Jeep
"TJ" Wrangler (Joanne couldn't find a VW Bus available). They will be hiking,
skydiving, camping, visiting friends and relatives, and just contemplating
life during the trip. You'll be able to follow their progress and experiences
