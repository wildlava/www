</p>
<p>AMAZING!! Excellent service and excellent food. I worked with
Patrick
who was very friendly and helpful - super nice guy! Helped bring the
price
down to our budget, and still had plenty of eclectic food for everyone.
Had a tasting for us BEFORE we put any money down. This may sound
strange,
but many places want you to put down your deposit before you try their
food! The Basil Tree gets HIGH recommendations from me.

<p>Ed was a nice guy and even met us for lunch at my request, even
though,
apparently, it's usually not done. He had a good price, had worked at
our
venue, The Habitat, before, and had a good selection. One thing that
wasn't
perfect for us was that we wanted to have a list of songs for him to
play
and not take requests. We didn't want any bad music. He said he didn't
feel comfortable turning guests away if they asked him to play
something,
so we gave him a bunch of songs to play instead of the entire play
list.
Not a huge deal, but something to consider if that's what you really
want.

<p><b><font size="+1"><u>The Habitat</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></b>Belmont, MA 617-489-5050
</p>
<p>Beautiful old house with a good-sized "getting-ready" room (the
kid's
room), and a fairly large dance/dining hall with french doors opening
to
one of the gardens. Very peaceful, lots of flowers, grass, and trees.
Great
for small to medium ceremonies.

</p>
<p>Very laid back, quiet guy with a dry sense of humor which we loved!
He has a great artistic style and will do "typical" wedding poses as
well
as really unique photos. We let him go loose after the "required"
photos,
and we got some really great pics!

</p>
<p>I dealt with a seamstress there named Jackie who was such a doll,
and
EXTREMELY helpful.&nbsp; She made Joe's sash the same material as my
bodice,
and sewed the veil onto my headpiece in minutes.&nbsp; Hardly asked me
anything at all about my scribbly drawing which was my dress idea, but
gave great suggestions, then went to it!&nbsp; They also made Joe's
pants,
and everything was ready when they said it would be.&nbsp; They make a
lot of gothic clothing (it IS in Salem, Massachusetts!), but they'll
make
anything you like.
