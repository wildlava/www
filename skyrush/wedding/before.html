Wedding</font></font></u></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I woke up pretty early, having not slept very well the night before.&nbsp;
Even though I had taken the week off from work, and I am NOT an insomniac,
I hadn't slept well in the past few nights.&nbsp; Beginning to drift off
into slumber would allow my mind to think of details of the wedding that
I needed to remember, then I couldn't get back to sleep until I got up
and wrote it all down.
<p>Anyway, Joe got up and left for his bachelor day party.&nbsp; He spent
the day sailing with some of his friends.&nbsp; I was going to spend the
day on the beach with my friends, trying to relax.&nbsp; Yeah, right!
<p>I had a list of everything I needed to bring.&nbsp; Stuff for the beach
that day, errands I had to run before I went, my stuff for the wedding
tomorrow, and stuff for the day after my wedding to hang out on the beach
some more.&nbsp; Our plan was we were going to drive to an inn in Rockport
for our romantic wedding night, then spend the next day relaxing.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><i>TIP:&nbsp; Do not spend a lot of money on a hotel/motel/inn
for your wedding night unless you plan to spend a lot of time there.&nbsp;
You will be tired at the end of the day, especially if it's a later wedding.&nbsp;
Get a nice place, but just don't spend a lot more than you normally would,
okay?</i></blockquote>

<p><br>After making a few trips to my car from my fourth floor walk-up
apartment, stopping at my mother's to get the bucket of flowers, and some
other errands, I picked up Jenifer and Jamie and finally made it to the
beach.
<p>Jen, Jamie, Allison, Laurie and I spent the afternoon on the beach,
swimming, soaking up sun, and I TOTALLY recommend a day like this for all
you bride-to-be's before your wedding.&nbsp; I can't think of anything
that could have grounded me more than a great day with my friends!
<p>Later we ordered some food, then my brother dropped my sister off, and
hung out with all of us chicks for awhile, as well as my nephew, Daniel.&nbsp;
After the "men" left (hey, Daniel's only 4!), we proceeded to make our
bouquets.&nbsp; We all helped each other with what flowers to put in them,
and they all came out really nice.&nbsp; I was looking at the pictures
recently (I'm working on the photo album myself, but that's another story!),
and the flowers really looked great!
<p>To top the off evening, we had a little wine, we did our fingernails
and toenails, and watched a little "Austin Powers, International Man of
Mystery".&nbsp; I was one of the last ones to go upstairs to bed.&nbsp;
Tired, but knowing I would have a difficult time sleeping, I took a Benadryl.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><i>TIP:&nbsp; If you KNOW you are going to have a hard time
sleeping, and have not slept for a few days, I have nothing against taking
something to help you sleep BUT, and this is big, BUT make sure you have
taken it before and you know how it will affect you.&nbsp; You don't want
to be groggy, or sleep through your own wedding!</i></blockquote>

<p><br>The last thing that night that happened was the phone rang, very
late, and I jumped up to grab it, knowing it would be Joe.&nbsp; Yup, it
was.&nbsp; It was kind of a relief to talk to him, it just made me feel
a little better.&nbsp; The last thing we said was "I'll meet you at the
bush".
