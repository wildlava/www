<center><b><u><font size=+2>(Hopefully) Helpful Tips</font></u></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>These tips come from my experience of handling a lot of stuff myself,
so if you're having a hall do everything, like some kind of wedding package,
you probably won't need all these tips, but you might find something useful
here.&nbsp; This is also aimed a lot at short engagements, like mine.&nbsp;
(No, I wasn't pregnant, for those curious people!)

<tr>
<td>TIP:&nbsp; If you even THINK you are going to get engaged, and think
it may be a short engagement (6 months or less), try thinking about what
kind of dress you would want to wear NOW.&nbsp; That way you spend less
time trying on a thousand dresses since you already have an idea of what
you want.</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP:&nbsp; When you get engaged, if you possibly can hold it in, don't
tell anyone for 24 hours.&nbsp; Share this time with your special someone.&nbsp;
The moment the news gets out, it will feel like a tidal wave is being created.&nbsp;
The momentum is incredible!</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP:&nbsp; Right after you get engaged, no matter how crazy your special
someone thinks you are to do this so soon, the two of you should sit down
and make a preliminary guest list.&nbsp; That will be the foundation of
how large (and expensive) your wedding will be.</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP: Do not spend a lot of money on a hotel/motel/inn for your wedding
night unless you plan to spend a lot of time there. You will be tired at
the end of the day, especially if it's a later wedding. Get a nice place,
but just don't spend a lot more than you normally would, okay?</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP: Arrange with someone before your wedding day (whether the maid
of honor, the wedding consultant, someone) to set up everything how you
want it. Walk through the hall with that person and say "I would like this
here, and that there" etc. There is NO WAY you are going to be able to
do it yourself as the bride.</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP: Figure out all the picture arrangements you would like to have,
and everyone who is going to be in them, and in which order they will be
taken BEFORE the wedding. Tell your photographer ahead of time. It wouldn't
hurt to have someone else know this as well (the coordinator, a friend)
who can round people up while the photographer is doing his/her job - taking
the pictures. Otherwise, you, the bride, are the one yelling for people
to get in the group - not a pretty sight, and something you just shouldn't
have to deal with then.</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP: Drink lots of water! No matter what time of year you have your
ceremony, you will be so busy, and probably tired, that you will become
dehydrated, thus losing more energy and become a wilting bride. Have some
champagne and drinks if you want, but do not forget the water.</td>

<tr>
<td>TIP: If possible, choose a relative or close friend to make sure you
get a chance to spend time with everyone at the wedding by giving them
something like a list of names, or having them ask you "Who have you not
talked with?". At an assigned seating wedding it's easier to see everyone
by making your round of tables. At a wedding like ours where people were
everywhere all the time, it's easy to miss someone. People are always coming
up to you to take you somewhere, or ask you questions, and if there are
people you've invited who don't feel comfortable coming to you (they may
think you are busy) you need to make sure you can go to them.</td>
