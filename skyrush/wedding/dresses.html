<td>The buttons looked really pretty against the dark material.&nbsp; This
is low in the back.&nbsp; I'm holding it because it was the wrong size
(huge on me!)</td>

<td>This top was really fun, and it comes in navy (they didn't have it
to try on).&nbsp; I liked the detail on the hem of the top.&nbsp; I couldn't
find this on their website.</td>

<td>I REALLY liked this top, but the skirt is a straight skirt and it was
a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; No slit in the back.</td>

skirt instead of this iridescent one.</td>

<tr>
<td>I thought this looked a LOT better on the hangar (plus it doesn't come
in navy).&nbsp; But I think this top is cool (it's a one piece that looks
like a 2-piece).&nbsp; It's plum (I know, the pics are not that good).</td>

<td>This actually looked pretty good when I pulled on the top so it wasn't
so big.&nbsp; The skirt is a fishtail (a little train in the back).&nbsp;
This was the most inexpensive outfit I tried on - $150.</td>
