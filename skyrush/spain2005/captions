Trip to El Escorial & Madrid, Spain - October, 2005;Here are pictures we took while on a trip to El Escorial & Madrid, Spain.  The first 1/2 of the trip was to attend the <a href="http://www.adass.org:8080/Conferences/2005/Venue/">ADASS conference</a> in El Escorial for work.<p>See Joanne's <a href="/joanne/spain_blog.html">blog</a> too!
Joanne gets excited for Spain as our flight nears conclusion.
The morning after our first [jet-lagged] day, we head up the hill with the other ADASS conference participants for a tour of the monastery.
Some doors had intricate artwork done completely in wood inlay.
A close-up of the inlay work - amazing how they used woodgrain for shading!
The monastery at San Lorenzo de El Escorial sits at the foot of nearby mountains.
Joanne walks down toward the entrance to the burial chamber of kings.
The dome of the burial chamber is 10 meters below the main alter in the cathedral above.
The casket of King Philip II
Some of the amazing ceiling artwork
This painting looks familiar - I may have studied it in art history!
The cross, arch, and other features on this wall look 3D, don't they?  It's actually a flat painting - the only part that is not flat is the gold framed piece in the center!
Some amazing frescos - these need restoration every now and then.
After the tour, we are outside the huge monastery.
Getting into the lower-level parking for the hotel proved challenging due to the narrow passageways.

On the morning of the <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEmono/ASE2005/ASE2005.html">annular solar eclipse</a>, the crescent shape of the sun can be seen focused through the leaves of a tree.
More sun crescents...
The light dims in an eerie and subtle way as the eclipse approaches.  Conference members gather at an "observation point" to witness the event.  Here I use the free eclipse glasses given to us.  I hear glasses like this sold out in Spain!
Joanne stares at the sun in apparent amazement.
I ran into Kristin that morning, whom I had met in Holland earlier in 2005.  She came for the eclipse and now sets up a telescope and projection screen for viewing.  She even attracts news media!
The "observation point" seems to be a sandy football field.
Kristin's apparatus does a great job of showing the eclipse.
Less and less of the sun can now be seen!
Look!  The moon's covering the sun!
These next pictures were taken simply by holding the eclipse glasses up to the camera lens...
Trying a different kind of glasses
Like in the last picture, the overexposure produces an interesting shape!
Back to the original glasses...
...
The annulus is starting to complete.
...
The annulus ring is now visible!
...
And we have totality (although 9% of the sun's photosphere is still visible)!
Soon to be a crescent again
...
...
Conference participants stick around for a while.
Joanne stands with ? and Kristin.
I get in the picture to pose with the waning eclipse.
The place is almost deserted now!
The monastery looms above the field.
That night, Kristin and Diana join Joanne and me for dinner in El Escorial.
I, Joanne, Kristin, and Diana after dinner (Diana, from Madrid, was very helpful translating food items for us!)
We walk the streets of El Escorial after dinner.
...
Diana, I, and Jon dine at one of the conference lunches.
On the last day of ADASS, I say farewell to the "Euroforum."
...
Now in Madrid, Joanne and I visit a typical breakfast place in Puerta del Sol.
Patrons stand at a narrow counter and drink the coffee with their pastries.
"Jamon" (ham, especially the high-end "Iberico" variety) is abundant in Madrid.  Vegetables are not so common.

The Museo del Prado
After seeing all of the great art, we pose for a picture outside.

Near the Prado, we decide to visit a botanical gardens

An older couple walks near the Prado.
The Ritz!
An eternal flame representing, er, something!
Recorded opera music blasted from speakers near a giant screen on the opera house near Plaza de Oriente.
More scenes from Plaza de Oriente and Palacio Real...

Looks like King Philip IV - carrying the "royal stick" (we made that up)
Palacio Real

A typical and colorful screet in Madrid
Plaza Mayor
This street, viewed through an archway in Plaza Mayor is striking!
Joanne and I explore Plaza Mayor.
Streets generally are not strait, and right angles are scarse.
More streets and buildings...
...
We approach a little "Italian" cafe.
We await the "pizza."
...
...
...
Churches abound.
More crowded streets...
Here is our hotel, "Hotel Palacio San Martin," in a very central location of Madrid.
The old-fashioned elevator was cool!
Joanne liked it a lot.
Human "statues" were common.  Here, a man poses as a motionless matador.
Yummy!
Catedral de la Al Mudena near Palacio Real...

...
...
The door itself is a sculpture!
(a closer view)
It's Pope John Paul II!
Fountains in the gardens below
Another human statue - he saw my flash and looked at us!
I try to capture the feel of the crowded streets.
...
There was always a line to get into this monastery next to our hotel.
On the way to the airport, this tower is captured in dawn silhouette.
