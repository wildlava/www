Wow, everything's so green, even without much rain lately!
Here is a view looking south along the foothills of the Front Range
from a trail near the mouth of
Shadow Canyon (which works its way up between Bear Peak and South Boulder
Peak).  The "Mickey Mouse Cliffs" can be seen up to
the right!

A nice little cactus flower on the trail...

Here's a view of the plains (south of Boulder) beyond some large
red boulders that characterize this area on the slopes of the foothills.

These guys were fluttering around by a little stream that crossed
the trail.

<a href="matron_trail.jpg"><img align=left src="matron_trail.gif"></a>
Here we're looking up at the foothills from the slopes
south of Bear Peak.  The rock
formation you see in the center is called "The Matron."

We went snowshoeing recently to Brainard Lake, which is just north
of Nederland (west of Boulder).

This is a view from Brainard Lake.

Scott Adams (not the Dilbert guy!) joined us...

<a href="snowshoe4.jpg"><img align=left src="snowshoe4.gif"></a>
The weekend before, we went snowshoeing in Rocky Mountain National
Park.  Here with Joanne is Bengt, a tough guy from Sweden.

<p>

<a href="snowshoe5.jpg"><img align=left src="snowshoe5.gif"></a>
This is the view above Emerald Lake.  Getting here is a sneaker hike in
the summer, but snowshoeing was more challenging!  That's Hallet Peak
on the left and Flat-Top Mountain on the right.

Here are some previous pictures (posted in April of 1999, just after
we moved to Boulder):
</i>

<p>

<a href="bear_peak1.jpg"><img align=left src="bear_peak1.gif"></a>
I drove around the neighborhood (South Boulder) for a while to find
an unobstructed view of Bear Peak.  This can be seen pretty much
from anywhere in Boulder.  We hiked to the top recently (see pics below).
The rock jutting up on the left side is "Devil's Thumb."  We got a good
view of the back of this on the hike.  I took this and the next picture
because it had just snowed, and we wanted to save it before it melted!
<br clear=left>

<p>

<a href="flatirons1.jpg"><img align=left src="flatirons1.gif"></a>
Here's a view of the "flatirons" the same day from NCAR.  That's
the front side of Green Mountain, which is just north of Bear Peak.
<br clear=left>

<p>

<a href="shadow_canyon1.jpg"><img align=left src="shadow_canyon1.gif"></a>
The next five pics are from a recent hike to two summits
(South Boulder Peak and Bear Peak).  The colors on the rocks were wonderful,
as you can see here.  It's pretty much red rock with green lichen.

Joanne is fiddling with her video camera on South Boulder Peak.

<p>

<a href="shadow_canyon3.jpg"><img align=left src="shadow_canyon3.gif"></a>
The view from South Boulder Peak to the west.  The mountains in the distance
are (I believe) the Indian Peaks.

<a href="shadow_canyon4.jpg"><img align=left src="shadow_canyon4.gif"></a>
The south end of Boulder from Bear Peak.

The colorful Devil's Thumb!

These pictures were taken shortly after moving to Boulder
with Joanne's TRV-900 digital video camera in
still ("progressive scan") mode.  Click on the small pictures to see the
real thing!

<a href="bldr_apt1.jpg"><img align=left src="bldr_apt1.gif"></a>
Here's the front of our apartment!  Our unit is on the right side
of the main building (the higher one).  There's a basement apartment
below ours that you really can't see.
<br clear=left>

<a href="bldr_apt2.jpg"><img align=left src="bldr_apt2.gif"></a>
This is a view from out in front of the apartment toward the mountains
to the west.  They are fairly close, and these are the foothills of
the "Front Range" of the Rockies.
<br clear=left>

<a href="bldr_apt3.jpg"><img align=left src="bldr_apt3.gif"></a>
When it snows here, everything can go from spring-like to a
winter wonderland.  This is a view out our back window the morning
after the first real snow.
<br clear=left>

<a href="bldr_apt4.jpg"><img align=left src="bldr_apt4.gif"></a>
The snow often melts pretty quickly in the low-lands.
This is a view from the office down at my Jeep and Joanne's Bug by mid-day.
<br clear=left>

<a href="bldr_apt5.jpg"><img align=left src="bldr_apt5.gif"></a>
As you can see, a few days later the view out the back of our place
has turned back to its winter gold/brown color.  This area in back
is called "open space."  The government owns it, so it is kept free
of construction.  This is looking southeast, and we are near the southern
end of Boulder.

<a href="office1.jpg"><img align=left src="office1.gif"></a>
The office is now feeling lived-in.  The computer on the left is my
work machine.  The machine on the right is my personal one.
The machine to the lower left just behind the seat of the desk chair
is the network server
that hosts this web page!
<br clear=left>

<a href="office2.jpg"><img align=left src="office2.gif"></a>
Here's a closer look at my personal machine on the corner computer
table I just built recently.  Tables are expensive, and it's hard
to find the right height, so hey, building one was the way to go.
<br clear=left>

<a href="office_view1.jpg"><img align=left src="office_view1.gif"></a>
The view from the office isn't too bad!  This is the day after it snowed,
and the sky is still a bit blustery.  This is looking toward the northwest.
<br clear=left>

<a href="office_view2.jpg"><img align=left src="office_view2.gif"></a>
Another view from the office.  Here the sky has cleared and you can see the
tip of Longs Peak (a 14'er - that's over 14,000 feet)
rising over the lower mountains of the foothills.
<br clear=left>

<a href="longs_peak.jpg"><img align=left src="longs_peak.gif"></a>
I drove down the highway 2 or 3 miles toward Denver and stopped
at a high point to take some pictures back towards Boulder.  This is
a nice view of Longs Peak.
<br clear=left>

<a href="boulder1.jpg"><img align=left src="boulder1.gif"></a>
From the same high point you can see the snowy mountain range beyond
the foothills.  It really is breaktaking!  Southern Boulder is in the
valley below.  I'm not sure if our place is in this picture or not.
<br clear=left>

<a href="boulder2.jpg"><img align=left src="boulder2.gif"></a>
Another view to the right of the above view (looking northwest).
Longs Peak is on the right.

Here's what I <i>wish</i> my office looked like.  Thanks to
Peter McAuley at SynaPix for mocking up this dream!
