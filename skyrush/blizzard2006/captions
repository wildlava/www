Colorado's "Blizzard of 2006"
The day after all the snow fell, we open the garage door to find... snow drifts!
Is that my car under there?
Before people got out in droves to shovel, it looked pretty wild.
Joanne starts the sidewalk while I start the driveway.
Getting there...
And here comes a bulldozer down the street (not just a simple snowplow!).
All the neighbors stopped to watch the the plowing action.
Yeah, that's deep!
And now that the front is done, I blaze a trail to the hottub.
Got to have your priorities!
Pebbles decides she's had enough.
Well, maybe she'll think about it a bit.
Nope, goin' back in.
Not so fast!  Time for Pebbles to see what deep snow is all about!
That didn't last long - she's outta there!
Ah, the tub is ready for tonight, and we can even get to it!
As dusk approaches, it's looking like a white Christmas!
The bulldozer made a partial lane down our street, but lots of cars are still snowed in.
We have lights on our tree out front, and the snow adds effect.
Another picture of the tree and our house.  This time it's darker.
And a final one from our front door.  Merry Christmas!
