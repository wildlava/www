Snowshoeing Chasm Lake - March 18, 2007
As always, on the Longs Peak Trail, we started in the woods in good cheer!

The clouds above showed evidence of the same wind we witnessed below.
But it was a beautiful day, indeed!
Joanne poses with the lenticular clouds at the turnoff to Chasm Lake.

We gaze toward the "Ship's Prow" near Chasm Lake and The Diamond.

Joe stands with ice axe in hand after the traverse of the steep section near approaching the final scramble to the lake.
And now for some goofy shots...
...
Dan poses with his axe (actually, they were Shad's...).
Shad readies himself for the final scramble.
Ah, Chasm Lake reveals itself, its ice reflecting The Diamond.
The successful hikers pose with Longs Peak looming above.
"Still Life with Gear"
These rocks seemed carefully placed, but only nature knows why.
One last look at Chasm Lake and The Diamond of Longs Peak
Joanne pioneers the return across the steep traverse in order to ready her video camera to capture the rest of our crossings.
Now only a speck, Joanne can be seen mid-way across the slope.

A couple of Ptarmigans get in on the action as we descend the tundra.
These were beautiful birds, now camouflaged for winter, with "furry" feet!
...
Kristi "slides" down the snow in this "action shot".
Kristi and Joanne (holding up a miniaturized Dan) pause after their snow slides a short time before we re-enter the forest for the hike back to the trailhead.
