Full-moon Snowshoe from Chautauqua - February 2, 2007
Ouch, that flash is BRIGHT!
Here we are in the trees under the full moon!
The lights of the city are quite a feast for the eyes.
Even the clouds glow magically in the moonlight.
The snowscape was brilliant in the moonlight.
Boulder glows over the slopes of Chautauqua.
With the flash on, the depth of what the camera sees is very shallow.
...It looks much darker than here than it did with lights off.
After the hike, we relax at Walnut Brewery.
...
A waitress was nice enough to capture us finishing the meal.
