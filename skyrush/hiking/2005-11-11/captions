The Plateau below Pawnee Pass - November 11, 2005
While we get ready for the hike, Fathi demonstrates how fast he can move his head!
Many philosophical discussions take place along the way.
"Of course!"
The sky was cloudy at the start, making for a wintery scene.
The Sun starts to poke through!
...
That's hilarious!
...
"Would you not agree that, from time to time, the Earth appears to be banana-shaped?"
"No, if that were true, sheep's bladders could not be used to prevent earthquakes!"
There are many opportunities for making tracks on snow slopes.
The light plays with the small drifts of white.
"Don't crack me up while I'm taking a drink!"
"Whew - I forgot this is not a summer day!"
Contemplation before the ascent...
The sky is now clear over us, but it's a cloudy day back home in the plains.
We admire the view from the cliffs where we stopped to eat.
Fathi loves this stuff!
We play with the camera remote control at our lunch spot.
With the camera steady on a rock, we take self portraits.
...
Wow, tough climb!  :)
This is the left-eye view looking back to the east on our way down.
And now the right-eye view (put these together for a stereo view!)
The clouds are back, and it's snowing now - time for some nice forrest shots...
...
...
The moon makes an appearance through a wild gap in the clouds.
The sun sets behind Navajo Peak.
