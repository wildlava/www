South Boulder Peak & Bear Peak - June 3, 2006
Warren poses for a quick picture after we ate some lunch just before heading into Shadow Canyon (in the background).  Later, on the way back down (and shortly before emerging from the canyon at this trail junction), we saw a large black bear about 50 feet or so from the trail!  I heard a panting or rapid huffing before looking up and seeing it across from us.  Quite exciting!  Needless to say, we kept on moving at a normal pace and kept our distance.

A small and pretty flower on the trail down
Some evergreen needles
I think these are bluebells.
