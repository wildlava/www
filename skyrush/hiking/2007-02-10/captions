Snowshoeing The Loch - February 10, 2007
The first part of the trail from Glacier Gorge was snowy and wooded.
Allan and Jon Guido
The sun is starting to break through!
And it is lightly snowing.
The rocks at the side of the cliff before the drop into the river gorge
Now we can see some nice views as the sky becomes more blue.

Some ice climbers prepare for their ascent as we look on.
Shad, Allan, Joanne, Jon Guido, Don, Kristi, and Brent pause in a clearing before entering the gorge up to The Loch.
This is where it starts to get a little steep.
The grip of the snowshoes really pays off here!
Joanne, nearly to the top, and Shad way ahead with his 50 pound pack!
Looking back down, we see some of our group making their way up.
...
The sky takes on a nice blue as it clears a bit.

Shad returns to tell us about the "60 mile per hour" winds at The Loch.
We get ready to make the quick Loch visit.
"Hi!"
Approaching The Loch, we see many cool snow drifts.
Shad runs back for a second visit.
Jon Guido is not far behind.

Back in the gorge, on the way down, we stop by a cool ice formation.
Shad tests his ice axe.
Good thing he had a good grip in that ice!  :)
Sliding down the snow in the gorge became quite popular!
Looking back up the gorge
Jon Guido narrowly escapes collision with the rocks below.  :)

What a great day!
And so much snow!
This wind-blown part of the trail mimicked the look of spring.
Planning the next big adventure...
