Hut Trip to the 10th Mountain Division Hut - November 24-26, 2005
The night we got to the hut, Venus was just blindingly brilliant!
Joanne sits, reading by candlelight, in the comfortable warmth of the wood stove.
The next day, we prepare for some sking - without the packs!
...
Did I forget something?
Nope - I'm ready - let's go!
Joanne shows some XC ski moves!
Slide Lake sits quietly at the foot of the magestic mountains.
No one up here but us!
The pristine moon above the powder peaks
The quiet was deafening!
I wish that camera's timer was longer!
OK, it worked better this time.
We look damn good!
Yep!
The mountains to the south look great.
Not a cloud in the sky
And the peaks to the east are wonderful!
Pine cones, snow, and sky
...

There goes Joe, looking like a pro!

...
Whoa!  Nice action shot!
On the hut's deck, we relax late in the day.
Joanne poses while Nicole collects snow for water.
Homestake Peak makes a great backdrop.
Sarah, Nicole, and Mike geek the camera.

Looking down at how we approached the hut
Light is getting scarce, but I take a long exposure in the hut.
Mike, Susie, Jimmy, and others hang by the stove.
Jimmy stokes the fire.
Joanne reads by headlight.
Orion rises to the east in this 15 second exposure (boy was it getting cold out!).
...
A southern look out the upstairs windows the next morning
Joanne prepares for the ski out as other relax in the morning light.
Jimmy gets water from the snowmelt pot.
Joanne tightens her laces.
She checks the compass.
We're doing great!
Joe checks some stuff in his pack.
We're set!
Nice!
