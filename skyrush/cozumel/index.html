Cozumel, Mexico
</h2>

<i>
Cozumel, a small island off the Yucatan coast of Mexico,
is an amazing place.  I hope to perhaps write a trip report, but
not right now.  In the meantime, here are some pictures from our trip on
March 10th through March 17th, 1996.

Here's a cool panoramic shot of the "El Presidente Inter-Continental Cozumel"
(our hotel).  It's the best hotel on the island, and we got a great deal.

Ernesto's supposedly has the best fajitas on the island.  All I can remember
is how big the margaritas were...

Naked Beach.  Well, I'm not sure the real story here, but this was right next
to an isolated bar on the east side of the island, which is completely
deserted.  We has a drink there, took this picture, and hopped in the Jeep
to explore the rest of the harsh east coast.

The rock formations on the east coast are pretty bizarre.  This one was full
of holes where water washed up.

We ran into Kevin and Natalie, who were off one of the many cruise ships
for the evening.  They were very cool!

"We're gonna make it after all!" was playing in the background as we stumbled
through the streets near the Plaza.

Nacho took this of us at 55 feet while diving the San Cedral Pass.  I was so
psyched to get good underwater pictures!  Yes!<br><br>
