<tr><td align=center><h3><i>From the house on Summit, I used to mainly walk up to the Engineering Quad, since most of my classes, some horrifying and some kinda fun, where there that year.  This is a classic view of the old sundial that is the focus of the quad, and the building in the background is new - what a wild structure!  It's called Duffield Hall, and it has been glued onto and is in the process of engulfing Philips Hall (well, it looks that way, anyway).</i></h3></td></tr></table></body>
