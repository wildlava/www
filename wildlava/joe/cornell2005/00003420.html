<tr><td align=center><h3><i>Dunbar's was a totally classic dive bar and great alternative to actually studying.  I think CCR was the only music they had in the jukebox back then, and although that has changed, nothing else has.  When we stopped in later to check it out, the popcorn machine's glass sides were opaque and yellow with oil, the lights were low (good thing, since I doubt they have dusted for 20 years), and they still serve "group therapy" on Wednesday nights (Damn!  Off by one night!) for $6 (Meisterbrau has been replaced by another brand of "fine" beer, but you still get a pitcher and 6 kamikaze shots in the package - a sure recipe for disaster!).</i></h3></td></tr></table></body>
