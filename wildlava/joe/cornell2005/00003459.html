<tr><td align=center><h3><i>The Chariot was one of my favorites.  I think the Pizza was the best in town, and guess what: it's still great!  Laurie and I stopped in for pizza after hanging out at Ruloff's and Dunbar's, and Marcus, the manager pictured here, told us that (sadly!) The Chariot will be closing in a couple of weeks.  What a bummer!  Marcus said he used to work at The Nines (a competing Pizza joint) the years I was a student!</i></h3></td></tr></table></body>
