<tr><td align=center><h3><i>The stairs where the painting hangs go down to the Ivy Room, a popular hangout in The Strait.  Through the left doorway and down another staircase is "Okenshields," one of the dining halls, where you could get such excellent dishes as brown rice lasagna, broccoli lasagna, and [probably] other strange forms of this classic pasta dish!  Those of us in the know mostly went to Sage Dining Hall, probably the best on campus (and Cornell was actually known for it's much better-than-average college dining!).  Sadly, Sage Dining Hall is gone now (Sage Hall was completely renovated).</i></h3></td></tr></table></body>
