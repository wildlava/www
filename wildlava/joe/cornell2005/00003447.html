Here you can see some carpet patches, and I bet these are the original carpets - they are pretty dirty looking now.  Those black corner guards on the walls are new too - I bet the students (over 20 years!) did a number on them.  Here's an old view down the same hallway: <a href="old_pics/pat2.jpg">(click here)</a></i></h3></td></tr></table></body>
