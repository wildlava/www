DEEP THOUGHTS

Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is
why several of us died of tuberculosis.
<p>
Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word
itself: "Mank ind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words-
"mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and
that's why so is mankind.
<p>
I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king,
they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas
with some good ideas.
<p>
It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at
that man.
<p>
I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all
skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that
said, "I helped skin Bob."
<p>
I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane
crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the
crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke
up and go, "What was THAT?!"
<p>
The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.
<p>
Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can
bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has
little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it
could be like ambition.
<p>
I'd rather be rich than stupid.
<p>
If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of
conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't
think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So sue me."
<p>
If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of
danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr.
Brave man, I guess I'm a coward.
<p>
I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every
culture, is the story of Popeye.
<p>
When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is
if they ever press charges.
<p>
To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
<p>
What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river to
save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.
<p>
We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff
at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me.
<p>
Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort
of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.
<p>
I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon
was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand,
pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality.
<p>
To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I
went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.
<p>
As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it that
was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a nectarine at
all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!
<p>                            
Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have
been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws,
can make a child look like a deer.
<p>
If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.
<p>
Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks
his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.
<p>
You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown who
make people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has severe
diarrhea.
<p>
Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to
calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring the
doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know
what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in
the side of it's head with a note that says "You." After that I
usually feel a lot better, and no harm done.
<p>
If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then
gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.
<p>
If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is
to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see,
we build to that.
<p>
If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because
maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you
because, hey, free dummy.
<p>
I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high
notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals.
<p>
Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto
someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have
to laugh, because what is that thing.
<p>
He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much
he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed
her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher
said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot
them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you
in heaven--with a gun."
<p>
The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to
me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it
was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think
there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in
the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger,
older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I
think we went home. I guess some things never leave you.
<p>
If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell
him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another
cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did."
<p>
Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the
world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's a
shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating
everything they see.
<p>
As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks."
Marta said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her she
should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she
started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a simple
letter! And I thought I was lazy!
<p>
One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to
take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an
old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand burned
down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it
was a pretty good joke. 
<p>
If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you
think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd
be wrong, though. It's Hambone.
<p>
Laurie got offended that I used the word "puke." But to me, that's
what her dinner tasted like.
<p>
We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing. But
we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with some
whore he picked up in town.
<p>
I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came
to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.
<p>
As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint
gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how
gray he was, and how I named him Flint.
<p>
If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's
real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.
<p>
Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my
first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant,
and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.
<p>
If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to
pretend you were swimming.
<p>
When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After
school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he
would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that
Uncle Caveman was a bear.
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
More Deep Thoughts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures. They're sort
of like dogs. Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur.
<p>
Marta likes to talk about sensuality, but I don't think she would know
sensuality if it bite her on the ass.
<p>
If you drop your keys into molten lava just let 'em go 'cause, man, they're
gone.
<p>
Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old
stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the
treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have
a plane to catch, you know." He stared telling his story, about the
treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long."
But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is
getting long." But then the story was over, and I said to myself: "You
know, that story wasn't too long after all." I forget what the story was
about, but there was a good movie on the plane. It was a little long,
though.
<p>
Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo,
flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a very
beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful
painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk.
<p>
In weightlifting, I don't think sudden, uncontrolled urination should
automatically disqualify you.
<p>
Blow ye winds, like the trumpet blows; but without that noise.
<p>
When the age of the Vikings came to a close, they must have sensed it.
Probably, the gathered together one evening, slapped each other on the back
and said, "Hey, good job."
<p>
I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning and
nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his. Then he'd spin it
round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and no matter where it stopped
he'd yell out, "Tadpoles! Tadpoles is a winner!" We all thought he was
crazy. But then we had some growing up to do.
<p>
If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land,
because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the
impression we are trying to convey with our store. On the other hand, we
would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless
a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control.
<p>
I wish I had a kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula
AND Superman away.
<p>
Too bad you can't just grab a tree by the very tiptop and bend it clear
over the ground and then let her fly, because I bet you'd be amazed at all
the stuff that comes flying out.
<p>
I remember that one fateful day when Coach too me aside. I knew what was
coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?"
"Well," said Coach, "you never were really ON the team. You made that
uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy
space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and
make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at
inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I
thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees
something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when
I felt the handcuffs go on.
<p>
When I heard that trees grow a new 'ring' for each year they live, I
thought, we humans are kind of like that: we grow a new layer of skin each
year, and after many years we are thick and unwieldy from all our skin
layers.
<p>
Martha says the interesting thing about fly fishing is that it's two lives
connected by a thin strand. Come on, Martha. Grow up.
<p>
The old pool shooter has won many a game in his life. But now it was time
to hang up the cue. When he did all the other cues came crashing to the
floor. "Sorry," he said with a smile.
<p>
If I ever do a book on the Amazon, I hope I am able to bring a certain
lightheartedness to the subject, in a way that tell the reader we are going
to have fun with this thing.
<p>
Even though he was and enemy of mine, I had to admit that what he had
accomplished was a brilliant piece of strategy. First, he punched me, then
he kicked me, then he punched me again.
<p>
If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the
cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but
instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then,
later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake
cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, "Boy, these are good
cigars!"
<p>
The sound of fresh rain run-off splashing from the roof reminded me of the
sound of urine splashing into a filthy Texaco latrine.
<p>
I think somebody should come up with a way to breed a very large shrimp.
That way, you could ride him, then after you camped at night, you could eat
him. How about it, science?
<p>
I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting. "That was
fun," I said. "You bet it was," said Nick. "Let's climb higher." "No," I
said. "I think we should be heading back now." "We have time," Nick
insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we did. We argued back and forth
like that for about 20 minutes, then finally decided to head back. I didn't
say it was an interesting story.
<p>
Too bad there's not such a thing as a golden skunk, because you'd probably
be proud to be sprayed by one.
<p>
To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion. Truth is real. And, at the
same time, unreal. Fiction and fact and everything in between, plus some
things I can't remember, all rolled into one big 'thing'. This is truth, to
me.
<p>
I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going
to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may
the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start,
and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could
explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a
good laugh.
<p>
I think in one of my previous lives I was a mighty king, because I like
people to do what I say.
<p>
Today I accidentally stepped on a snail on the sidewalk in front of our
house. And I thought, I too am like that snail. I build a defensive wall
around myself, a 'shell' if you will. But my shell isn't made out of a hard
protective substance. Mine is made out of tinfoil and paper bags.
<p>
A man doesn't automatically get my respect. He has to get down in the dirt
and beg for it.
<p>
If you're ever stuck in some thick undergrowth, in your underwear, don't
stop and think of what other words have 'under' in them, because that's
probably the first sign of jungle madness.
<p>
Sometimes the beauty of the world is so overwhelming, I just want to throw
back my head and gargle. Just gargle and gargle, and I don't care who hears
me, because I am beautiful.
<p>
Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an
astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into
Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just
slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and
say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again, bat man."
<p>
I wish scientists would come up with a way to make dogs a lot bigger, but
with a smaller head. That way, they'd still be good as watchdogs, but they
wouldn't eat as much.
<p>
I bet for an Indian, shooting a old fat pioneer woman in the back with an
arrow, and she fires her shotgun into the ground as she falls over, is like
the top thing you can do.
<p>
I think a good movie would be about a guy who's a brain scientist, but he
gets hit on the head and it damages the part of the brain the makes you
want to study the brain.
<p>
I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fisherman caught a big shark and
cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person
open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't
a person, because itwould be too small. But there's a little doll or
something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy-- something like that.
<p>
It makes me mad when I go to all the trouble of having Martha cook up about
a hundred drumsticks, the the guy at the Marineland says, "You can't throw
chicken to the dolphins. They eat fish." Sure they eat fish, if that's all
you give them. Man, wise up.
<p>
If the Vikings were around today, they would probably be amazed at how much
glow-in-the-dark stuff we have, and how we take so much of it for granted.
<p>
It's not good to let any kid near a container that has a skull and
crossbones on it, because there might be a skeleton costume inside and the
kid could put it on and really scare you.
<p>
If you had a school for professional fireworks people, I don't think you
could cover fuses in just one class. It's just too rich a subject.
<p>
People think it would be fun to be a bird because you could fly. But they
forget the negative side, which is the preening.
<p>
If I live in the Wild West days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my
holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That was if some smart-aleck cowboy
said something like, "Hey look. He's carrying a soldering iron!" and
started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say,
"That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then
everyone would get real quiet and ashamed, because they made fun of the
soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free
drink.
<p>
When I think back on all the blessings I have been given in my life, I
can't think of a single one, unless you count that rattlesnake that granted
me all those wishes.
<p>
I hope in the future Americans are thought of as a warlike, vicious people,
because I bet a lot of high schools would pick 'Americans' as their mascot.
<p>
Sometimes I think the world has gone completely mad. And then I think, "Aw,
who cares?" And then I think, "Hey, what's for supper?"
<p>
If you ever discover that what you're seeing is a play within a play, just
slow down, take a deep breath, and hold on for the ride of your life.
<p>
I can see why it would be prohibited to throw most things off the top of
the Empire State Building, but what's wrong with little bits of cheese?
They probably break down into their various gases before they even hit.
<p>
If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in your act, I
don't think it's a good idea to also dress the dog up like a clown, because
people see that and they think, "Forgive me, but that's just too much."
<p>
Here's a good joke to do during an earthquake: straddle a big crack in the
ground, and if it opens wider, go "Whoa! Whoa!" and flail your arms around,
like you're going to fall in.
<p>
If you ever go temporarily insane, don't shoot somebody, like a lot of
people do. Instead, try to get some weeding done, because you'd really be
surprised.
<p>
It makes me mad when people say I turned and ran like a scared rabbit.
Maybe it was like an angry rabbit, who was running to go fight in another
fight, away from the first fight.
<p>
I think a good way to get into a movie is to show up where they're making
the movie, then stick a big cactus plant onto you buttocks and start
yowling and running around. Everyone would think it was funny, and the head
movie guy would say, "Hey, let's put him in the movie."
<p>
Instead of having 'answers' on a math test, they should just call them
'impressions' and it you got a different 'impression' so what, can't we all
be brothers?
<p>
If God dwells inside us, like some people say, I sure hope He like
enchiladas, because that's what He's getting!
<p>
Probably to a shark about the funniest thing there is is a wounded seal,
trying to swim to shore, because WHERE DOES HE THINK HE'S GOING?!
<p>
Perhaps, if I am very lucky, the feeble efforts of my lifetime will someday
be noticed, and maybe, in some small way, they will be acknowledged as the
greatest works of genius ever created by Man.
<p>
It's sad that a family can be torn apart by something as simple as a pack
of wild dogs.
<p>
If they ever come up with a swashbuckling School, I think one of the
courses should be Laughing, Then Jumping Off Something.
<p>
When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future, don't stick
your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a fossil.
<p>
At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be
"Clark Kent, Dentist," because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But
then I thought, if a patient said, "How's my back tooth?" and you just
looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, "Oh it's okay," then the
patient would probably say, "Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?"
and you'd say, "Aw fuck you, get outta here," and then he probably wouldn't
even pay his bill.
<p>
A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite. Then you
call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone. "Hear that?" you
say. "That's dynamite, baby."
<p>
Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better treatment"? I'd ask
for a pinball machine, because with all that rocking back and forth you'd
probably be able to get a lot of free games.
<p>
I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a high rack,
above the ground. That way, you could get hit by meteorites and not even
feel it.
<p>
I bet when the Neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always
end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy brows." Then they would all
get embarrassed because they remembered they had the big hunky brows too,
and they'd get mad and eat the snowman.
<p>
Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin
real fast and freak everybody out.
<p>
The people in the village were real poor, so none of the children had any
toys. But this one little boy had gotten an old enema bag and filled it
with rocks, and he would go around and whap the other children across the
face with it. Man, I think my heart almost broke. Later the boy came up and
offered to give me the toy. This was too much! I reached out my hand, but
then he ran away. I chased him down and took the enema bag. He cried a
little, but that's the way of these people.
<p>
I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more planets
fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system.
<p>
I wonder if Dracula ever has ticks.
<p>
When this girl at the art museum asked me whom I liked better, Monet or
Manet, I said, "I like mayonnaise." She just stared at me, so I said it
again, louder. Then she left. I guess she went to try to find some
mayonnaise for me.
<p>
He was a spy, all right, and he knew it. He would walk into a room and
people would go, "Who the fuck is that guy, a spy?" He'd laugh to himself,
maybe pull out his gun and show it to the person, to kind of impress him
(but not to show off). Sometimes spying was dirty work. Sometimes he'd kill
a guy, then paint a clown face on his face. Nobody said he had to do that,
but he did it anyway. So, dirty work.
<p>
I bet it's hard to break farmers of the old superstitions like "Tornado got
Old Yeller, stay in the cellar."
<p>
I don't guess I've ever been as scared as when I was waiting in the
principal's office. Finally he came in and sat down. He didn't say
anything, he just looked at me. Then he pulled a copy of Playboy out. "Is
this yours?" he said. "No," I said, "is this yours?" And I pulled out my
penis. I guess I wasn't as scared as I thought.
<p>
If Alien was my friend, I'd like to be with him when he went to the
dentist. When they started drilling, he'd probably go nuts and start eating
everybody. That Alien!
<p>
Why do there have to be rules for everything? It's gotten to the point that
rules dominate just about every aspect of our lives. In fact, it might be
said that rules have become the foot-long sticks of mankind.
<p>
I hate it when people say somebody has a "speech impediment", even if he
does, because it could hurt his feelings. Soinstead, I call it a "speech
improvement", and I go up to the guy and say, "Hey, Bob, I like your speech
improvement." I think this makes him feel better.
<p>
Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it "dull" that
Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it
didn't seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, so he
went to a doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat
down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he
got to see the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that
dull?
<p>
Some folks say it was a miracle. St. Francis suddenly appeared and knocked
the next pitch clean over the fence. Other folks say it was just a lucky
swing.
<p>
I think one reason I could be a good playboy is I would be willing to spend
the time required to really fix up my "pad".
<p>
To me, it's always a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when
you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a hand?,"
you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."
<p>
I think a good gift for the president would be a chocolate revolver. And
since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him and hand it to
him.
<p>
Of all the tall tales, I think my favorite is the one about Eli Whitney and
the interchangeable parts.
<p>
If there was a terrible storm outside, but somehow this dog lived through
the storm, and he showed up at your door when the storm was finally over, I
think a good name for him would be Carl.
<p>
If I had a mine shaft, I don't think I would just abandon it. There's got
to be a better way.
<p>
I think man invented the car by instinct.
<p>
I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play I ran up
and lit the evil puppet villain on fire...
No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the
human emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when
you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is
generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid
puppet.
<p>
I think there should be something in science called the "reindeer effect."
I don't know what it would be, but I think it'd be good to hear someone
say, "Gentlemen, what we have here is a terrifying example of the reindeer
effect."
<p>
I saw on this nature show how the male elk douses himself with urine to
smell sweeter to the opposite sex. What a coincidence!
<p>
I think it's high time we started questioning the old cliches like "Grunt
big for Daddy."
<p>
Anybody who has an identity problem had better wise up and get with the
program!
<p>
Tonight, when we were eating dinner, Marta said something that really
knocked me for a loop. She said, "I love carrots." "Good," I said as I
gritted my teeth real hard. "Then maybe you and carrots would like to go
into the bedroom and have sex!" They didn't, but maybe they will sometime,
and I can watch.
<p>
I think they should continue the policy of not giving a Nobel Prize for
paneling.
<p>
One question that's never been answered to my satisfaction by the "Playboy
Advisor" is "What kind of stereo system works best in hell?"
<p>
A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by
a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten
feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with
him about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying.
That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke.
<p>
Folks still remember the day ole Bob Riley came bouncing down that dirt
road in his pickup. Pretty soon, it was bouncing higher and higher. The
tires popped, and the shocks broke, but that truck kept bouncing. Some say
it bounced clean over the moon, but whoever says that is a goddamn liar.
<p>
Just as irrigation is the lifeblood of the Southwest, lifeblood is the soup of
cannibals.
<p>
In some places it's known as a tornado. In others, a cyclone. And in still
others, the Idiot's Merry-go-round. But around here they'll always be known
as screw-boys.
<p>
I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my money for
about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick. Then I'd go out West
and start digging for gold. When someone came up and asked what I was
doing, I'd say, "Looking for gold, ya durn fool." He'd say, "Your pick is
gold," and I'd say, "Well, that was easy."
<p>
I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby duck,
which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until
you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then, all of a
sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man, those
ducks really take off! Also, Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.
<p>
Laugh, clown, laugh. This is what I tell myself whenever I dress up like Bozo.
<p>
Any man, in the right situation, is capable of murder. But not any man is
capable of being a good camper. So, murder and camping are not as similar
as you might think.
<p>
The prince decided he would learn anger. So he gathered his subjects
together outside his balcony. Who would teach me anger?" he said. "Fuck
you!" somebody yelled. "Okay, how about algebra?" said the prince.
<p>
If you go to a party, and you want to be the popular one at the party, do
this: Wait until no one is looking, then kick a burning log out of the
fireplace onto the carpet. Then jump on top of it with your body and yell,
"Log o' fire! Log o' fire!" I've never done this, but I think it'd work.
<p>
As the snow started to fall, he tugged his coat tighter around himself. Too
tight, as it turned out. "This is the fourth coat crushing this year", said
the sergeant as he outlined the body with a special pencil that writes on
snow.
<p>
I read that when the archaeologists dug down into the ancient cemetery,
they found fragments of *human bones*! What kind of barbarians were these
people, anyway?
<p>
I'll be the first to admit that my idea of God is pretty different. I
believe in a God with a long white beard, a gold crown, and a long robe
with lots of shiny jewels on it. He sits on a big throne in the clouds, and
He's about five hundred feet tall. He talks in a real deep voice like
"I...AM...GOD!" He can blow up stuff just by looking at it. This is my own,
personal idea of God.
<p>
Here's a good trick: Get a job as a judge at the Olympics. Then, if some
guy sets a world record, pretend that you didn't see it and go, "Okay, is
everybody ready to start now?"
<p>
The land that had nourished him and had borne him fruit now turned against
him and called him a fruit. Man, I hate land like that.
<p>
Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a direct hit from
a big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull and you pull, but you can't
get the rock out of the ground. So you give it a good kick, but you lose
your balance and go skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes
a big Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because they
thought it was real pretty. He tells you to get out of there, but you start
faking it, like you're talking Hawaiian, and then he gets mad and chases
you . . .
<p>
It's fascinating to think that all around us there's an invisible world we
can't even see. I'm speaking, of course, of the World of the Invisible
Scary Skeletons.
<p>
Whenever I hear the sparrow chirping, watch the woodpecker chirp, catch a
chirping trout, or listen to the sad howl of the chirp rat, I think: Oh
boy! I'm going insane again.
<p>
If they have moving sidewalks in the future, when you get on them, I think
you should have to assume sort of a walking shape so as not to frighten the
dogs.
<p>
He was the kind of man who was not ashamed to show affection. I guess
that's what I hated about him.
<p>
I think college administrators should encourage students to urinate on walls
and bushes, because then when students from another college come sniffing
around, they'll know this is someone else's territory.
<p>
The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very
large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat. And if
someone asks me why I didn't get more meat, I'll just say, "Oh, you mean
this?" and pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes,
where I've hidden it. Good magic trick, huh?
<p>
I think my new thing will be to try to be a real happy guy. I'll just walk
around being real happy until some jerk says something stupid to me.
<p>
If you work on a lobster boat, sneaking up behind people and pinching them
is probably a joke that gets old real fast.
<p>
If you want to be the most popular person in your class, whenever the
professor pauses in his lecture, just let out a big snort and say "How do
you figger that!" real loud. Then lean back and sort of smirk.
<p>
Too bad Lassie didn't know how to ice skate, because then if she was in
Holland on vacation in winter and someone said "Lassie, go skate for help,"
she could do it.
<p>
When you're going up the stairs and you take a step, kick the other leg up
high behind you to keep people from following too close.
<p>
If you're ever shipwrecked on a tropical island and you don't know how to
speak the natives' language, just say "Poppy-oomy." I bet it means
something.
<p>
I wish scientists would come up with an ear of corn that was big and round,
because then when you were eating it, it'd be fun to make chew marks in the
shape of continents.
<p>
I wonder if angels believe in ghosts.
<p>
I have to laugh when I think of the first cigar, because it was probably
just a bunch of rolled-up tobacco leaves.
<p>
I don't understand people who say life is a mystery, because what is it
they want to know?
<p>
Instead of studying for finals, what about just going to the Bahamas and
catching some rays? Maybe you'll flunk, but you might have flunked anyway;
that's my point.
<p>
Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody
called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to stand up in class
and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to,
but to me he's just like everybody else." Then everybody would leave the
Cricket Boy alone, and I'd invite him over to spend the night at my house,
but after about five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him
out. Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family run
out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy.
<p>
The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he worked hard
and saved his money. True, working at the hardware store didn't pay much,
but he felt it was better than what everybody else did, which was go up to
the volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned
out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody
left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to collect
gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he broke his
leg and the doctor's bills were real high.
<p>
If I had a nickname, I think I would want it to be "Prince of Weasels",
because then I could go up and bite people and they would turn around and
go, "What the-?" And then they would recognize me, and go, "Oh, it's you,
the Prince of Weasels."
<p>
As the sleek new sports car wound its way up the tortuous road, Henri
thought back to the torture he had received ten minutes ago. "Ah, air
conditioning", he thought as he aimed the vents toward the numerous whip
marks on his legs, chest, and groinal area.
<p>
I hope, when they die, cartoon characters have to answer for their sins.
<p>
Marta was watching the football game with me when she said, "You know, most
of these sports are based on the idea of one group protecting its territory
from invasion by another group." "Yeah," I said, trying not to laugh. Girls
are funny.
<p>
Whether they ever find life there or not, I think Jupiter should be
considered an enemy planet.
<p>
When the chairman introduced the guest speaker as a former illegal alien, I
got up from my chair and yelled, "What's the matter, no jobs on Mars?" When
no one laughed, I was real embarrassed. I don't think people should make
you feel that way.
<p>
It's amazing to me that one of the world's most feared diseases would be
carried by one of the world's smallest animals: the real tiny dog.
<p>
One thing that makes me believe in UFOs is, sometimes I lose stuff.
<p>
I guess more bad things have been done in the name of progress than any
other. I myself have been guilty of this. When I was a teenager, I stole a
car and drove it out into the desert and set it on fire. When the police
showed up, I just shrugged and said, "Hey, progress." Boy, did I have a lot
to learn.
<p>
Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the night, with
no other cars around, I start imagining: What if there were no civilization
out there? No cities, no factories, no people? And then I think: No people
or factories? Then who made this car? And this highway? And I get so
confused I have to stick my head out the window into the driving rain -
unless there's lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt.
<p>
The difference between a man and a boy is, a boy wants to grow up to be a
fireman, but a man wants to grow up to be a giant monster fireman.
<p>
I think the monkeys at the zoo should have to wear sunglasses so they can't
hypnotize you.
<p>
Sometimes life seems like a dream, especially when I look down and see that
I forgot to put on my pants.
<p>
Love can sweep you off your feet and carry you along in a way you've never
known before. But the ride always ends, and you end up feeling lonely and
bitter.  Wait. It's not love I'm describing. I'm thinking of a monorail.
<p>
I bet it was pretty hard to pick up girls if you had the Black Death.
<p>
Sometimes I wish Marta were more loyal to me. Like the other day. The car
parked next to ours had a real dirty windshield; so I wrote THIS CAR LOOKS
LIKE A FART in the dirt. Later I asked Marta if she thought it was a
childish thing to do. She said, "Well, maybe," Man, whose side is she on,
anyway?
<p>
Sometimes I wonder if I'm sexy enough. When I walk into a singles bar with
my "fashionable" shirt, "fashionable" slacks, and a big new rubber
manta-ray helmet. I can't help wondering: Do women want to talk to me for
myself, or do they just want to get a feel of that nice rubber manta skin?
<p>

Still More Deep Thoughts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
   I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed out
 that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because
 I  was thinking about doing that anyway.
<p>
   If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
 mirror, because  I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.
<p>
   I hope if chickens ever take over the world and they choose a king,
 they  don't just go by leg size, because I'd hate to have to kneel
 before Kevin Wechtermilk.
<p>
   If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons
 (maybe by shoving them down his throat).
<p>
   If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying
 forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.
<p>
   It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money.  And
 I guess that's what I like about it.  It's easy.  Just sitting there,
 rocking back and forth, wanting that money.
<p>
   If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a beer,
 I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose.
<p>
   As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red
 again, I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing more than a
 bunch of honking and yelling?  Sometimes it seemed that way.
<p>
   I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate.
 And I can  picture us attacking that world, because they'd never
 expect it.
<p>
   I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs
 in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea
 but it's just eggs hatching.
<p>
   Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there,
 in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good
 books.
<p>
   What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds
 singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want
 to get drunk?  And after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the
 public park and stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay
 down and go to sleep.
<p>
   Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window?  The guy looks
 out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out.  Wait.  I guess that's
 like a regular window.
<p>
   If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people,
 like I am now.
<p>
   When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call
 the police.  But then I got curious about it.  I picked it up, and
 started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.
<p>
   Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know
 anybody: First take out the garbage.  Then go around and collect any
 extra garbage that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and
 take that out too.  Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy
 garbage guy.
<p>
   Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your
 rights, even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the
 person is you're talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door.
<p>
   If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your horse, I
 bet it would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was
 reading a magazine.
<p>
   Broken promises don't upset me.  I just think, why did they believe
 me?
<p>
   If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't you
 think a good costume would be to dress up like the boss's wife?
 Trust me, it's not.
<p>
   Consider the daffodil.  And while you're doing that, I'll be over
 here, looking through your stuff.
