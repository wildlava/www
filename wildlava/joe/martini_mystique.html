The Martini Mystique
</h2>


<h3><i>
The unshaken choice of the suave, debonair, and sophisticated, the martini
 is an icon--the classic supreme among cocktails.  It is also,
as you shall soon
find out, notorious for stirring up debate among its enthusiastic fans.

            One devotee said of the martini, "The proper union
            of gin and vermouth is a great and sudden glory; it
            is one of the happiest marriages on Earth and one
    of the shortest lived." It is also the subject of enthusiastic
    debate and endless tinkering.
<p>
       Personal preferences aside, cocktail fanciers everywhere
    can agree that the martini is the classic supreme.  Long and
    lean, cool and sophisticated, it is the Fred Astaire of mixed
    drinks.  It is an icon: Long before airport sign makers
    swapped words for symbols, bartenders knew
    that a large neon martini glass spoke volumes in
    any language.
<p>
       So much for agreement. Disagreement is
    what martinis are about.  Martini fans are
    famously disputatious, but        even teetotalers
    sometimes join their arguments: Everyone's an expert.
<p>
       And they argue about
    practically everything, as
    William Grimes notes in his
    witty history of drinking,
    <i>Straight Up or On the Rocks?</i>
    Its origin, for example.  Some
    call martinis British, named
    for the fierce kick of the
    Martini-Henry rifle carried by
    Empire troops.  Others say it's
    Italian, from Martini & Rossi
    vermouth.  Pretty flimsy, eh?
<p>
       Grimes says it's American,
    but he remains aloof from
    both East Coast and West
    Coast nativity theories.  Which
    are: 1) a San Francisco bartender
    created the first martini
    for a traveler bound for nearby
    Martinez, 2) a Martinez
    barman made it for a man
    going to San Francisco,
 3) it was born 'in New York City around 1880 or was
 invented there by a barman named Martini at the Hotel
 Knickerbocker in 1912.
<p>
 Some clues support the Eastern claim, while the West's
 is weakened by others, like the notion that a bartender
 would slake a stranger's thirst by electing (out of the blue,
 as it were) to create a brand-new cocktail on the spot.  But
 such minutiae are best suited to scholarly, dispassionate
 examination over drinks.  Martinis, for example.
<p>
   The drink flowered in the 1920s, boosted,
 ironically, by Prohibition, the United States'
 "great experiment" (1920-1933) in outlawing
 beverage alcohol.  The citizenry grew mutinous;
 smugglers and bootleggers thrived; temperance
 did not.  Cocktail parties became social alternatives
		    to liquor parlors called
                    "speakeasies" and "blind pigs."
<p>
                      Oddly, the martini was
                    and is almost puritanically
                    simple (gin, vermouth, and an
                    olive garnish) and austerely
                    pleasurable.  Bracing as a
                    dose of wind chill, a martini
                    in its conical stemmed glass
                    has the severe elegance of a
                    Bauhaus masterpiece, like the
                    cocktail shakers featured in
                    the Design Collection of
                    New York's Museum of
                    Modern Art.
<p>
		      Roman decadence soon
                    followed.  The lush prosperity
                    of the 1950s fostered the
                    infamous three-martini lunch
                    among the expense-account
                    set.  The martini joined the
                    Establishment.  Rebellious
                    youth adopted antiestablishment
                    alternatives in the
   1960s and '70s: rock'n'roll, bell-bottom trousers, and cheap wines--some
   made from apples, others
   carbonated, all ghastly.  In the fitness-crazed
   '80s, Americans began drinking
   mineral water or, if in a daring mood,
   wine spritzers.  Bartenders found
   themselves serving citrus-decked
   glasses of bubble water priced as high
   as the Beefeater martinis that had
   fallen into desuetude.  People bought
   them anyway.
<p>
     But resilience is any classic's backbone:
   You can't keep it down.  The
   martini is back, suddenly and
   everywhere.  There are even martini-making
   contests.  In Seattle, Mike Rule of
   Oliver's won in the classic category for
   the second straight year.  Miami
   Beach's John DeLuca scored for that
   Art Deco jewel, the Raleigh Hotel.
   At Martini's Restaurant in New York
   City, martini olives are stuffed with
   anchovy or prosciutto (for vodka
   martinis, stuffings are lemon and
   rosemary or chipotle chili pepper).
   Martini's customers choose their
   stuffings as they choose their steaks
   (beef or shark).
<p>
   One reason for the martini comeback
   is that we drink smarter now,
    shunning excess and abstention both
    for moderation.  We'll have, perhaps,
    just one drink before dinner, so let it
    be the best.  Let it be a perfect martini.
<p>
     Smart marketers have caught on.
    Tanqueray gin features a spokesman
    named Mr. Jenkins.  Patrician but
    stylish, severe but hip, he exemplifies
    the martini mystique.  Bombay
    Sapphire and Finlandia gins are
    pushing hard, and Beefeater's, of
    course, is the defending champion.
    In vodka martinis, Absolut and
    Stolichnaya compete spiritedly.
<p>
    What is a perfect martini?  Herman
    Wouk said it "sort of tastes like it
    isn't there at all, just a cold cloud."
    But he didn't say how to make one,
    probably because he was, at the time,
    writing <i>The Winds of War</i>, not trying
    to start one.
<p>
    Therefore, in the interests of science
    we outline here the inflammatory
    questions and controversies.  From
    sheer cowardice we remain strictly
    neutral.  Afrer all, the perfect martini is
    your martini.
<p>
    <i>Gin or vodka.</i>  Gin is the original
    ingredient.  Martini's owner Rick
    Krause says "gin is assumed, vodka
    must be specified" (but the '60s term
    "vodkatini" is, as the British say,
   "twee").  Still, vodka, the former
   USSR's sole successful invader of the
   United States, outsells gin 2 to 1.
<p>
      <i>Vermouth.</i>  Front-runners include
   Cinzano and Noilly Prat, but any
   top-drawer dry vermouth suffices.
   (Sweet vermouth, acceptable before
   World War II, hasn't been mooted
   in decades.)
<p>
     <i>Proportions.</i>  Holdouts insist on
   3 to 1, but today's martini isn't really
   dry at less than 6, 12, or even 15 to
   1. For truly Saharan aridity, add
   vermouth with an eye-dropper.  Mr.
   Jenkins simply "coats the glass."
   Extremists "show the vermouth to
   the gin."
<p>
     <i>Garnish.</i> Olive and lemon twist,
   like Man and Woman, have vociferous
   supporters and profound differences;
   the twain do not meet.  Olivians split
   over regular and stuffed.  Stuffed
   enthusiasts like imaginative stuffings
   and scorn mere pimento.  Black olives
   are out, out, out.  Toothpicks excite
   little furor; their use has declined since
   novelist Sherwood Anderson died
   after swallowing one.  But frilly cellophane
   toothpics--well, what would
   Humphrey Bogart have said?
<p>
     <i>Mixing/chilling.</i> James Bond said
   "shaken--not stirred." Shaking
   provides faster chilling with less dilution
   from melted ice.  But the stir-crazy
   allege, seriously, that shaking "bruises
   the gin." As for martinis on the rocks,
   both factions laugh them to scorn.  To
   minimize dilution, purists refrigerate
   gin or vodka, and Mr. Jenkins chills
   the glasses, too.
<p>
    Finally, there's the unmartini.  Bereft
   of gin and vodka, the Hennessy
   Martini is cognac with lemon juice.
   Delicious--but is it a martini?  Is
   Seagram's and lemon a Canadian
   Martini, or Canatini?  Is there a
   Bourbon Martini?  Hard to say,
   actually, because perfect martinis
   include style and attitude as key
   ingredients.  So maybe tossing an olive
   in your beer makes a Malt Martini--<i>if</i>
   it tastes like a cold cloud.
