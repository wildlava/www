When I was a kid, I lived near Wilmington, Delaware.  I loved (and still do)
any kind of old tower that I could climb to see the world from a little
higher perspective.  One such tower was Rockford Tower.  It had a marvelous
spiral staircase made of old stone.  I used to wind up into the tower in
the dim light and eventually emerge at the top, where the view was, well,
pretty cool!  Recently I picked up a beer that I had never tried before.  When
I looked at the label, the memories started rushing back to be.  The tower
pictured looked strikingly familiar.  A few moments later I realized this
was <i>the very tower</i> I used to climb!  The beer is mighty tasty too.
