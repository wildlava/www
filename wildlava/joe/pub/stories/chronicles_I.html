James stepped aside as the well-dressed man bolted forth from the
restroom in what could be construed as a state of urgency.  As James
closed the door behind him, the din of the restaurant was dulled to a
distant murmur.  A faint, tinny voice caught his attention as he peered
into the mirror at his unshaven red scruff.  It was coming from the
corner of the bathroom.  He approached the waste basket, and the voice
got louder. Resting upon the wadded up paper towels was a small tape
recorder, and it was set in play mode.  James reached in and gently
grabbed the machine to have a better listen.

The voice seemed calm at first, but this was clearly forced.  The man
who had made the recording was obviously under extreme stress.  James
rewound the tape to the beginning to hear more of the recording, pressed
play, and locked the bathroom door:

"...collapsed.  His pulse was faint.  We tried - we really did.  But the
risk was too great.  No one should know this much; we knew that!  If
anyone hears this, you *have* to help.  It would be completely neglegent
to let this go.  That's what they want me to do, and unfortunately I am
not able to fight anymore.  I saw the flame for too long.  Don't look at
it!  But if you do, don't stare.  You'll know it's the one when you see
the sickly yellow color - not like a healthy flame at all.  Horrible... 
My courage is gone, but please don't let this happen to countless
others.  It's too important for our survival, even now..."

The recording came to an end, the last sound caused by the mystery man's
thumb as it fumbled for the stop button.  James grabbed a wet paper
towel and wiped the recorder clean of his fingerprints just before
throwing it back into the trash.  He left the bathroom, forgetting what
he had come in for.  The din was back to full force as he walked out
into the bar and slid up on a stool.  As he placed his order with Mary
for a martini, a hand slid onto the bar from behind him, leaving a
folded piece of paper, but as he tried to turn his head, his ear was met
by a whisper, "Please help us."
