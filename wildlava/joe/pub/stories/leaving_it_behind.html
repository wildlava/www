"Leaving it Behind"

The odor of electricity mixed with oil shocked my senses and yet brought
back familiar and comforting memories.  The subway station was just
ahead, and the gentle and hot evening breeze carried the stimulus to my
nose in the midst of the clatter of city noises - cars honking, street
drummers hitting upturned plastic buckets, the homeless inventing clever
reasons for needing your pocket change.  I passed by the subway station
and pushed on the metal door frame of an ancient entranceway, feeling
the slick of handsmudge from one hundred patrons before me.  Nick, who
had manned the hot dog shop for more than fifteen years, held out his
hand to me with a big smile and a cocked head and a welcome hello.  He
was a fixture here.  If I had seen him on a train or in an office
somewhere, I would have never known from where I knew him.

I spent almost no time grabbing a quick dog, saying my see-ya-laters to
Nick, and walking back into the sweltering street once again.  I could
see the mirage of wavy heat way down the street, and I could hear the
bouncing of basketballs and the screech of sneakers making harsh contact
with the concrete.  These sounds all came and went as I walked the long
street leading to the harbor dock where my freedom was waiting.  Yes, I
was free before, but not as I would be, not as my dream dictated.  Nick
didn't know that I was unsure of ever returning to his little shop.
Tears welled in my eyes as I tried not to look back, knowing that this
chance to get away also meant saying goodbye to a certain comfort.

The boat and Sarah awaited ahead, almost too far to make out, but I knew
her from her movements.  She did not see me yet, as she was busily
prepping our floating home for the next months.  When I got closer, and
Sarah looked up, her face brightened and her hair bounced back with a
quick flick.  "I've done it!" I told her.  "I told the old man to stuff it!"

We shoved off, puttering out of the harbor.  The sea smell grew more
organic and fresh as we left the chemistry of modern man behind.  The
sun was low now, and we only planned to get as far as Humphrey Rock
tonight.  Moments before, the solid feel of the ground and street had
given way to a feeling of constant motion.  We were adrift, our sails
set high, trying to eek the last bit of oomph from the dwindling evening
warmth.  Humphrey lay ahead, clear and clean in the orange light,
wondering why we never came its way sooner, puzzling about what we saw
in the big city.  But we loved the city, with its distractions and
frenzy.  We would return again to the city, maybe this one, maybe
another, and our break from the lights and sounds would let us see it
with new eyes that are aware and alive and have tasted a hint of the
world untouched by humankind.
