[...The Egg seemed to be the very core of the universe to James...]

James trudged through the rain hardly noticing that his leather jacket
was now soaked through.  His hands were in his pockets, and he gripped
The Egg as if his life depended on it.  Swinging around the lightpost at
the corner of his street, he instinctively followed his habitual track
to the door of number 453 Hollow Street.  Whereas usually James would
waste no time in getting out of his soaking clothes, tonight he had
other priorities.  He must look again at this strange device in the
privacy of his abode.

James rushed upstairs, still tightly gripping The Egg.  When he got to
his bedroom, he carefully set it down on two old hankerchiefs.  Now for
the fun part!  He once again gripped The Egg by its ends, applying
pressure carefully.  Funny, the ends seemed hard as granite; that soft
give was missing.  He squeezed harder, but still the stubborn shape
remained.  Frustration started to build within him.  He felt like
smashing the damn thing on the sidewalk below his bedroom window!  All
he had wanted was a drink or two.  Why had this alien object entered his
life on this particular night?

Time for rest, he thought.  Maybe this was all a bad dream.  The
darkenss of the room made The Egg look like a void - a hole in the space
above his dresser.  James couldn't take this enigma any longer.  If it
was still there by morning, he would be able to examine the situation
more calmly, he thought.  He took a towel off his bedpost and scrubbed
it over his auburn hair before throwing his clothes into a heap at the
foot of his bed.  Sleep engulfed him quickly, and the clock ticked on.

Slowly The Egg rolled upright.  It took about 15 mintutes to reach this
position, after which the top stretched up into a thin appendage and
soon widened into a dish shape.  The dish rotated down a little and
turned to face the window.  James' sleep became deeper still...
