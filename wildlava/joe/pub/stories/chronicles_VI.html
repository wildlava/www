[...the TV's tinny voice drilled into their heads...]

Sarah and James could not believe what they heard on the news.
The president of the United States had commited suicide.  A
sobbing First Lady was being interviewed, and through her tears
she told of what sounded like insanity setting in.

She also mentioned that all the president had talked about
over the previous three days was the importance of "an egg."

James stopped hearing the TV as his mind withdrew into itself.
He told Sarah, without looking at her, "I have some work to do.
It's important.  Can we meet tonight?"

Sarah, confused, replied, "Um, OK, but I thought we were going for
a picnic...  And I want to tell you about a strange man I saw down at
the corner - he scared me..."

James was already rushing upstairs, and he muttered, "Sarah, really,
I'm sorry.  I'll explain later."  With that, Sarah left, still confused,
but trusting James as she always did.  James got dressed and walked
outside, heading toward the train station.  Still in a daze, he
rode the train to the country - to his favorite spot, which no one
else seemed to have discovered.

James' father had owned two stores downtown.  They were gourmet food
stores, and yes, they carried many kinds of unique bird eggs.  James
thought of this as he lay outside in the field going over and over the
events of the last two days.

The Egg was safely in his pocket, with its firm marble surface clearly
pressing on his upper leg.  It still felt cold, like marble does when it
has been away from human touch for a while.  But James thought it
strange that it hadn't warmed up to the temperature of his leg.  Ahh,
nothing compared to the strangeness he'd seen though.

He felt alone, and as he tilted his head in both directions to look at
this green field from a rodent's perspective, he saw only the edges of
forests.  This was comforting, and yet the frequency with which he
scanned his surroundings was rising.  Paranoia was setting in.  James
forced himself to relax and think of being somewhere else - somewhere
out of this place and time.

And it worked.  He was relaxing.  Much of the acute sensation he felt
was gone and replaced by a soothing warmth.  Even the cold of The Egg
had faded.  Wait!  He didn't feel it at all, in fact!  Now the tension
was rushing back in - he'd been too complacent, he thought to himself.
Without hesitation, he reached into his pocket to find The Egg.  It was
there, but it now felt soft and warm.  His thumb sank into it and he
didn't like what he felt.  It was as if hundreds of tiny insect legs
were pricking his thumb.  He tried to pull it out, but it had a firm
grip on him!

Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a stranger.  A small man
with pocky face and dark-rimmed glasses and short greasy hair walked
up.  James started to back away, but the man said, "There's no reason to
fear me.  Ahh, but why should you believe me?  See I bleed like you..."
With this, the man took out a knife and slit his middle finger, letting
the blood run down his arm.
