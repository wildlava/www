"The Fireball"


The light slowly became blinding, and the scientists turned their heads
reluctantly, for their curiosity was great...

(Two hours earlier)

Dr. John Cabot and his post-doctoral student, Dr. Jamie Ryan, clambered
over the reddish rocks of the Arizona desert with one goal in mind: to
witness Earth's next big meteor hit.  The human race had once again spun
the giant roulette wheel, and this time we had not been so lucky.  For
there it was.  Nicknamed "The Reaper," it was about 200 feet in
diameter, large enough to produce a blast of about 50 megatons and
capable of destroying a city.  This was no replay of the event that
killed off the dinosaurs; that one was much bigger, but the name given
to this rock by the press instilled great fear in people the world over.
The experts in the field had tried to downplay the danger, but it was
too late for that.

What Dr. Cabot knew was about where this piece of iron would likely hit.
He did not know exactly, but he knew it would be somewhere within a
500 mile radius of that same area of Arizona where the famous Meteor
Crater stands as a testament to its impact so many thousands of years
ago.  Cabot knew there was danger in trying to see the event, for he
could be putting himself and his colleagues in its path, unable to
escape.  But none of them cared, especially Jamie, who had a passion for
her field that made Dr. Cabot very proud.  This was a once in a
many-lifetime chance.  And there was new technology to bear on this one.
John Cabot was a pioneer in the field of biochronography, which was
the study of the human perception of time.  He had figured out a way,
through the use of nanotechnical drugs, to speed the events in the human
body by many times, allowing an observer to witness events in what
seemed like slow motion.

John and Jamie approached the crest of a small hill, their boots dusty
with red and grey dirt.  It was nearing dusk.  John took one last look
at the map, and with a deep and labored breath he said, "Jamie, we are
here.  I don't want to go any farther toward the predicted impact site.
We are already in grave danger, but I think we are at a safe distance.
We should be in for a show."

With that, he reached into his pocket and extracted a vile containing
two tiny purple capsules.  The meds were the latest batch of what Dr.
Cabot called "Turbo Kickers."  He handed one to Jamie, and they each
opened their canteens, popping the pills, and clinking a toast.

It was now well into twilight, and the next five minutes were spent in
silent meditation.  They now turned to the east, the direction from
which they expected to see the fireball.  Jamie felt a sudden rush of
dizziness, and she looked at John, who had already started to appear to
be in slow motion.  His movements were sluggish, but they were starting
to catch up.  One unavoidable effect was that the inertia of the human
body remained in "real time," so even though the mind raced on, movement
was difficult.  Jamie reached her hand out to John as if she were
pushing through thick syrup.  He looked at her slowly, but she knew he
was catching up.  His expression indicated their speeds were similar.
They talked a little, but the sluggishness of the vocal chords made it
hardly worth the effort.  They turned and looked back to the east.

The sky was filled with stars, flickering and undulating slowly in the
atmosphere.  Some were brighter than others, but one stood out now.  It
was glowing steadily and growing brighter.  My God, that was it!  Jamie
and John turned their heads toward each other slowly with glee, but John
looked worried, only slightly.  The angle looked wrong, and the fireball
seemed too steady in its position.  Now the burning of the iron could be
seen plainly, and it grew large at a faster and faster rate.  It only
started to descend now slightly, but it was coming closer.  It was upon
them now!  John's mouth dropped open as the ball of fire dropped to the
ground not more than a football field's length away!

The iron ball, engulfed in flames, was nearly spherical, and as the
bottom of the ball struck the ground, a bright glow started and expanded
upward through the metal.  The ground now glowed as well, and the glow
was rising in intensity.  All reason had left John and Jamie now, but
the disbelief started to fade, replaced by fascination.  The light
slowly became blinding, and the scientists turned their heads
reluctantly, for their curiosity was great.  But now the realization
swept back over them that they were in trouble.  It was happening so
slowly, but they were so close to the impact.  Instinct kicked in and
overtook futility.  John turned slowly to Jamie and started to yell,
"Ruuuuunnnn!"

She looked back at him, about to get up, but then a smile came across
her face, her head tilted to one side, and she sat back down, lifting
her arms to the sky above in reverence to the glory she had just
witnessed.  She kept her eyes on John as long as possible, his
expression of panic fading into acceptance.  But the glow out of the
corner of her eye was too intense now, and soon the experience they had
just had turned into a quickly dispersing pattern of particles that only
the universe remembered, and it remembered for only a fraction of a
second.
