[...the Sun felt good after the dark night...]

The egg shell came down hard on the edge of the pan as James tried in
vain to pull his eyelids to a fully open state.  The sizzle of the egg
white on the pan was intense, and the egg bubbled up in a frenzy.  James
had never been good at this.

James' mind was now filled with thoughts of The Egg and that green arrow
it had so crisply shown on its face.  It was not like any earthly gadget,
that was for sure.  Apart from its impossible metamorphosis, everything
about it seemed tight, smooth, and crystal clear.  In fact, it seemed as
though the thoughts in James' head were growing more complex and zooming
through his head faster and faster now, which strangely contradicted
the fact that he felt more groggy than he had in a long time.
None of it made sense, but he knew one thing: he *had* to figure out what
this thing meant.  The fear on that audio tape and the urgency in the
well-dressed man's voice made this clear.  This was no joke, and somehow
James was caught up in something important.  For James, this was
a breath fo fresh air blowing the cobwebs out of his banal day to day life.

The old door chime sounded over the din of the small black and white TV
on the kitchen counter.  Slowly, James shuffled his feet into the front
hall and made his way toward the front door, his plaid bathrobe trailing

cold in his still-clammy hand.  A flood of light poured in as he opened
the old, heavy door.

Sarah's familiar face took on a look of concern.  "James!  You look like
you just got back from an alien abduction," she said sarcastically.

"Come in Sarah," muttered James as he turned and walked back toward the
kitchen.  "You are *way* too awake for me to deal with right now."  He
then ran both hands through his tossled hair futily.

Sarah's perky mood was matched by her crisp, short, brown haircut and
emaculate attire.  She always had that "perfect" look hat annoyed James
to no end.  They had known each other for many years, however, and
perhaps their polar opposition complimented their friendship.

"James, I have to tell you about what I just saw down at your street
corner..."

"Shh!" said James with a hand toward Sarah and his eyes glued to the
television.  On the screen was a news bulletin.  Both James and Sarah
sat enthralled as the reporter's shaky voice revealed the unthinkable...
