[When last we met James, he had just entered into a plot that may soon
make him beg for ignorance...]

The stranger backed away too quickly for James to get a good look.  The
crowd engulfed the man in the suit, and he soon became just like all of
the other post-work professionals seeking that buzz and distraction of
mindless conversation.  James turned back toward his martini and tried
to dive in and lose himself in the crystaline aroma.  He managed to wet
his lip and start the absorption of alcohol through his gums, which was
close enough for now.

Another martini passed, and it was time to go home.  Now having almost
forgotten the incident, all James wanted was sleep, but it would be a
long time before he could afford that luxury.  The night was hardly
over.  As he reached into his overcoat for his wallet, he felt a small
metalic object.  It was cold and very smooth.  He slowly pulled it out
into the dim light of the bar, readying himself for more surprizes.  It
was a deep black and shaped like a smallish egg.  There were no visible
seams anywhere.  He began squeezing it and rolling it in his hand almost
instinctively.  When he compressed it lengthwise, it felt different,
almost as if it gave a little.  He squeezed harder, and an amazing thing
happened!  A gap slowly appeared around the center and widened to allow
a dim red glow to show through.  James quickly put the egg onto the bar
in order to watch the rest of the transformation; he sat enthralled, and
now fully awake.

The ends of the egg shrunk until they were no more, and underneath was a
cylindrical object made of the same hard, dark substance.  It had a
glowing red band around the center, and one end was a perfectly clear
window covering a small screen with a pulsating green arrow.  One part
of James knew he should not touch this strange device, but his curious
side won.  No matter which way James held the device, the arrow always
pointed the same way, as if it were some sort of compass.  But it did not
point North, but rather in the direction of the door.  It was time to
leave anyway, so James held the device concealed at his side and moved
through the crowd, out the door, and into the rain.  James was inundated
by a soothing feeling of euphoria, and he gripped the device tighter. 
When he opened his palm and looked down, it was a dark egg again...

			CONTINUED NEXT WEEK...
