[...God, the blood just flowed and flowed...]

It was such an unnatural sight!  James was almost in shock, watching
the blood roll down the man's arm.  Still, his curiosity kept him
staring, as it always did.  "Are, are you OK??" muttered James.

"Yes," replied the little man, and he wiped the blood clean - too
clean - the cut on his finger was gone too.  "Will you trust me now?"

"Huh?" said James, blinking rapidly now.  "I don't know you."

"I was afraid of that," the man said as his smile faded.  He reached
into his overcoat pocked and pulled out a long and strange looking
needle.  Before James could react, the needle was in his abdomen,
and the world's light grew dim and then black.

When James awoke, he felt paralyzed, and his vision was blurry.  He
felt The Egg in his hand, and he barely managed to raise it into his
view.  There was the green arrow again, pointing straight ahead now.
In front of him was a dimly glowing flame.  It was cold and dark otherwise,
and something smelled of minerals or salt.  The air was moist and
unhealthy.  "Hello!?  Is anyone there?"

"Uhhhh, he-hello," a voice from about twenty feet ahead and to the
right manged to come out of the darkness.  "My name is - Theo."

"Hi, where are we?  Are you OK?" asked James as he became more alert.

"In a bad place.  My partner is dead, and so are many others.  They
keep us alive as long as they can.  Do not look at the flame!"

At that, James stared directly into the flame.  It was a sickly flame
indeed, just as that tape recording had said.  It was horrible.  It was
as of all of the suffering and sadness of humanity were in that yellow
and horrid flame.  To his left, James heard the voice of the little man.

"James, keep looking, and feel everything.  You seem different, but
you can help us if you feel it."

Just then, a feeling of great joy came from the flame.  It was like
a drug.  Wonderful!  James felt a rush of naked pleasure flow over
his body.  Then a dagger!  A horrible wrenching pain in his gut!  He
looked down, but there was no sign of a blade.  Then the sorrow, oh
the sorrow.  He started to cry.  Deep inside his head, he felt the
emotions from the flame penetrating.  He suddenly knew what this was
and why they were here.
