         		The Unease of Twilight


"Dude, how will I find you?" shouted Lance over the drone of the engines
and the rush of the 90 knot wind below the open tailgate.

But Dewitt simply looked up at Lance with a calm and naive smile and a
shrug of the shoulders as he fell away from the plane on his back,
flipping over to right himself before throwing out the pilot chute to
open his canopy.  It was only an hour until twilight, and Lance studied
the trees below, imprinting in his mind the shapes of the clearings for
when they would make the next pass over the area.  Lance still held the
sample collection equipment as well as most of the survival gear they
would need to set up camp that night in the forest below, and there was
Dewitt, alone and about to land in a remote area believed to be inhabited
by one of the most deadly emergent viruses known.

A few minutes later, the handheld radio crackled to life, and it was
Dewitt, "Lance, my man, the joker has landed, and it's a mighty fine
spot we have here.  All of the comforts of home.  Come on down!"

Lance had wanted to jump at the same time, but he wasn't prepared with
the gear, and Dewitt, the young and foolish kid, had decided to scout
out the area himself.  Lance walked away from the tailgate to the
cockpit and yelled to the pilot, "Bruce, I need you to take me around
again over the same spot.  Do you know where I mean?"

Bruce, without looking at him, said, "Sure, boss, no problem.  I'm just
glad it's not me who's going down there!"  The plane banked and pulled
way too many G's for Lance's taste.  It was an old plane, and metal
fatigue had been known to let let loose more than a few wings on these
old birds.  Lance reached down to feel the handle of his pilot chute
instinctively as he fought the imitation gravity.

The sunset was beautiful through the open door, and Lance walked back to
soak it in as it briefly slanted across his view.  He closed his eyes
and a smile washed across his face, now forcefully calmed by its owner
amid the threat of the danger that lay ahead.  The sunbeams through the
old and dirty windows combed along the floor of the plane, which was
strewn with seatbelts, old and chipped green paint, and tired looking
rivets.  Lance picked up the radio again, pushed the button, and said,
"Dude, are you still there?"

"Yah!  I'm enjoying the sunset, you?" exclaimed Dewitt.

"Hold tight and watch for me.  I'll be down soon," answered Lance, in a
rather deadpan voice, sounding slightly annoyed.

The plane had made a large circle and now was making a ground track over
what looked like the same area.  Still, the clearings did not look
right.  Bruce was now yelling to come to the cockpit.  When Lance got
there, Bruce's eyes looked wide as he pointed toward the fuel pressure
gauge.  Crap!  They were losing pressure, and to lose power now, over
this forest, would be bad, really bad.  Bruce put the plane in another
bank and turned toward the airport, where also the trees were less
dense.  Lance almost protested, but then realized he'd be endangering
them all.  He almost made a run for the tailgate to take his chances,
for they must be close to the spot now, but he hesitated; it could be a
few miles from where Dewitt was.  No, let's take this sanely, he
thought, although it pained him to sit on his hands, knowing the sky
would soon get dark, and who knew when they could make that second pass.
With nothing else to do, Lance attached the needed equipment to his
harness and folded his hands across the bulky pack.

The engines purred along, giving no indication of fuel starvation.  They
sounded strong.  Lance walked stiffly back to the cockpit, reached over
Bruce, who was madly stuttering on the radio to warn the control tower
of a possible emergency, and knocked his knuckles on the fuel pressure
gauge.  It sprung to life and went into the green!  "Idiot!!!" screamed
Lance at Bruce.  "Turn this thing around now!"

The long shadows from the trees below were gone now, and the dim green
of the clearings melded into the dark of the groves.  It was all a mush
of dimness down there.  Lance got back on his radio to call Dewitt.  He
tried several times, even turning down the squelch to reveal the
background noise.  He checked the frequency.  Yep, it was right.  He
yelled louder into the radio, as if this would do any good.  A sinking
feeling came over him, and he had to fight away panic.  How would he
find the guy?  Oh, crap.  Crap.

"Bruce, did you mark the position on the GPS?" he badgered the pilot.

"Are you freakin' kidding?  GPS?" replied the pilot, clearly no longer
feeling like cooperating at all.

Fuck, thought Lance.  "All right, just give it your best shot and take
me over that area again, this time at 1500 feet."  He strained his eyes
at the ground below, trying to see patterns and trying to even remember
what it was he was looking for.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a
flash of dim orange, and looking in that direction revealed what looked
like Dewitt's collapsed canopy in one of the small clearings.  "See you,
thanks!" he yelled as he made a run for the door.

Freefall felt so good, but from 1500 feet he could not afford to enjoy
it for too long.  He threw the pilot chute sub-terminal and felt the
soft opening of fabric.  At this altitude, he worried about making the
same clearing, but no problem, luck was on his side, and it was right
below.  Lance spiraled down and set up to sink it in right next to
Dewitt's canopy.  The landing was soft, but Dewitt was nowhere in sight.
 By the marks in the brush, it looked like Dewitt had walked into the
forest; maybe he had dropped his radio while navigating the thick
vegetation.

And there it was!  The radio was on the ground below, caked with a
little blood.  Oh, no!  Was he injured, or worse?  Lance dropped his
gear right there and started to run, following the trail through the
brush in the dim post-twilight.  Up ahead, a flicker of orange light
caught his eye, and he ran faster.

"Hey Bud!  Glad you could join me!" slurred Dewitt, sitting by the
make-shift campfire as he took a swig from his flask.  Dewitt stood up
and put out his blood-caked hand to shake, but the first thing he felt
was Lance's fist striking him in the jaw.

"Why am I surrounded by imbeciles today?" mumbled Lance, as he sat next
to the fire and watched the flames dance.
