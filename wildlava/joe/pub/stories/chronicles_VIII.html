[...they would not make a rat of him...]

A lab rat!  That's what he was, as well as the others who were
subjected to this.  The flame was an interface of sorts, subjecting
his mind to stimuli and collecting his thoughts.  These beings
obviously did not understand that human minds are fragile and cannot
take this.  How many had gone mad in the hands of these creatures?

"Come over here!" James yelled at the man.  "You are hurting us.
Maybe you mean well, but we cannot take this.  You must be a
very intelligent being.  Do you understand what I am saying?"

"Excellent, most excellent.  It will be OK, just relax.  Now, The
Egg is ours.  I will take it now."  The little man leaned closer,
and James felt a rubbery hand prying apart his fingers, which
clenched The Egg.  As the adrenaline in his system started to flow,
James felt his power of movement coming back, and in what seemed
like a goofy maneuver, he pinched the little man's disgusting little
nose, which felt rubbery and cold.  The man looked surprized and
faltered just enough for James to wrestle his hand free, hurling
The Egg in the direction of Theo's voice.  "Theo, burn it!"

The Egg, now in Theo's hands, turned translucent and then crystal
clear, except for a levitating green arrow, still pointing at the
flame.  Theo started crawling toward the flame, but as he approached
it he felt overwhelmed by sadness.  His world dissolved into a
pit of despair, and he stopped, kneeling there in front of the
flame, his head hanging low, and his hand still gripping the
crystal Egg.  And then, in what seemed to be a final burst of
will, Theo took a deep breath and stood up.  He walked toward
the flame with his hand outstretched.  As The Egg touched the
heat, a red light began to glow from inside it

James pulled harder on the man's nose, and then he felt something
give.  The nose seemed to become mushy and then ethereal.  The little
man flickered and started to fade.  He seemed to be sinking away and
into the rock below, and with a final red flash, he was gone.

Theo, with a yelp, let go of the egg, which now looked cracked and
sooty.  A dim red glow still smoldered inside, but as the glow
dimmed, so did the flame.  The pedestal on which the flame burned
put forth a thin line of greenish smoke.  The little man was a
projection, or perhaps something for which humans do not have a
word, but it seemed that the connection to whoever controlled The
Egg was broken.

"How did you know?" asked Theo.

"Good question," replied James, now a little out of breath.  "There
was just something about that thing.  It had some kind of power
over all of us.  It had to be the center of things."

Just then, the light from a flashlight appeared around the rocky
corner of what now revealed itself as a dark and dank cave.  Glenn
and Ilsa rounded the corner with a sense of urgency, and were
greeted with glee by Theo, who pointed at James and said, weakly,
"This guy is good.  Maybe we should hire him for real!"

James looked at Glenn, did a double-take, and then said, "It was
you, wasn't it - in the bar?"

"I'm sorry, James, I know you've been through a lot.  Can we buy
you a martini and make it up to you?"
