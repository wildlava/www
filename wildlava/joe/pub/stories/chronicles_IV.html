[...meanwhile at the Secret Government Laboratory...]

Ilsa Thad paced back and forth over the black and white tile floor and
twisted her hair repeatedly around her left index finger.  She suddenly
turned and said, "Are we *sure* those agents were lost?  They were under
deep cover, right?  Perhaps they are onto something."

"No, Ilsa, they had strict orders not to spend more than four days
inside.  I've worked with Bill and Theo for too many years.  I just hope
they're OK," retorted Glenn Miller sternly.  Glenn was the director of
the Lab and principle strategist for Operation Uncover.  He had been
working in intelligence for many years, and it showed.  There was grey
creeping around his temples and distinct wrinkles around his hazel eyes.

Ilsa dropped her head and walked to her chair, where she slumped down
and rested her chin on her folded hands.  Unlike Glenn, she was a rookie
at this, but she loved it!  She had that fresh energy, brilliance
and naivete.  Her eyes sparkled behind her cat-eye frames, which just
barely held her straight brown hair from her face.

"We must send someone after them, then!" blurted Ilsa, now becoming frantic.

"No!  No.  We cannot risk losing more.  And I fear that they give
themselves away.  I mean, no matter how deep the cover, it seems
that the cover does not last.  Their thoughts betray them, Ilsa.

"And now I suspect the president is in danger.  He *is* a target,
after all.  Yes, we must figure this out, but we need a different
approach.  I should not tell you this, as it is a gamble and top
secret, but I sent an operative to find an innocent, and one
has been found.  It is our only hope.  Only someone who knows nothing
can penetrate their defenses.  Our first agent, the one who found The
Egg, almost did just that, but he *was* an agent, and it gave him away.

"The president demanded to see The Egg last week, and we complied.
He's always been so damn hands-on.  We do not understand this thing,
and I warned him of the danger, but he's bull-headed.  The look in his
eyes when he gave it back worried me.  It seems to affect some people
strangely, but it is vital to our fight.  Thank God we have it, and now
the innocent has it.  I wish him the intuition to follow it and the courage
and curiosity to see this through.  He has not been trained, but maybe
that will benefit him.  I don't know if we had the right to involve
this guy, but we have no other alternative.  He does not realize
what hangs in the balance, and that is probably a good thing.

"We have a light!" exclaimed Glenn as he rushed over to the red phone
receiver on the large, angled control panel.  "It could be them.  God, I
hope it's them..."

...MORE NEXT WEEK...
