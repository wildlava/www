Pub Nite Lives at Jae's Cafe!
</h1></center>

<i>
Pub Nite: more than a time or a place...a feeling.  Many years ago a
tradition was begun.  It started as a small group of friends determined
to break up the work week with a sense of fun and togetherness.  Soon,
folks representing all kinds of interests gathered every Thursday at
a relatively new bar (then) in Cambridge, Massachusetts called Jae's Cafe.
Food there is eclectic Asian, including awesome sushi and some great Korean
dishes.  The drink of choice, well for some, remains the Bombay

memories and images of Pub Nites past...

Upon arriving at Jae's, I was pleased to see that our favorite hostess
and bartender (if we weren't missing Mary and Megan, it would have
been "bartenders") were there!

Relative newcomers to Pub Nite, Rob, Tracy, and Larry showed early to
get things going.  Larry successfully sold the bartender his AVS stock.

Affectionately known as "Papa Smurf," Josh seems astonished at Jim's
description of how he will soon light his mouth on fire, while Ed
Looks on.

Here I am with Peggy, Warren, and Allison.  We had to tell Allison
to stop eating that plant with the red leaves.  They're poisonous.

Another fine looking group: Josh, Pub-regular Martha, Warren, Jim, Allison,
and Dave.  This was before Jim burned his mouth with Sambuca.

of historical knowledge that exists on the peculiarities of the Earth's
crust in Togo, Africa.

Just before videoing his beer, John turns the camera on me.  Later
some guy passed us on the way to the rest room, and John convinced him
he was being broadcast live on the Internet.  What a dope!

I think Joan's upper right fillings may need replacing;
what do you think?

During a brief interruption while finishing his beer, John exclaims,
"Hey, I think those fish are doing it!"

Martha sits in resignation of tonight's imminent end,
but she also basks in the satisfaction of having been a part of
yet another splendid PUB NITE!
