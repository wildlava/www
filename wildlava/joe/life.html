Life is a big subject, and I certainly don't pretend to cover it all
here, but maybe reading this collection of random thoughts and interests
of mine will give you a glimpse into who I am.

A little [more] about me...
</h3>
Everyone has favorite foods, and anyone who knows me can tell
you that mine are clearly
<a href="martini.html">martinis</a>,
<a href="http://www.rain.org/~hutch/sushi.html">sushi</a>
(this link was one of the first sushi-related pages I saw on the Web,
 and it's still
there!), and really spicy food.

As far as music goes, jazz has to be my favorite, and I gravitate toward
the improvisational - especially piano and trumpet artists.  I'm also into
progressive rock and dancing at Manray in Cambridge, MA.

Check out one of the best <a href="newyears.html">New Years</a> I've had.
If it looks like we were having fun, well, we were!  On the partying note,
Hanging out with my friends after <a href="ski.html">skiing</a>
has been one of my all-time favorite ways to have fun.

Here is my astrological
<a href="astro_chart.html">chart</a> and
<a href="astro_interp.html">interpretation</a> for your amusement!
As for Myers-Briggs personality types, my type has shifted over the years.  I seemed to be an ENFP years ago, but I think I'm more of an ENTP now - could be slight differences in the tests I took, though!  Want to figure out what <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu:80/personality/keirsey.html">you</a> are?

Does life imitate art?
</h3>
Hey, I guess one of the great things about the Web is that even non-artists
can show what they've done.  So I am putting some stuff here for your perusal.
Don't expect greatness, but hey, you didn't have to pay admission, right?
