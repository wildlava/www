Ahh, there's nothing like fresh mountain air, especially right after a
bit of rain and fog.  This summer (1995) we set out to climb
<a href="http://hikethewhites.com/moosilauke.html">Mt. Moosilauke</a>
in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  Luckily, we did not get wet, but
the moisture made the colors simply amazing!

We took a lunch break at the
<a href="http://hikethewhites.com/b_b_shelter.html">Beaver Brook
Shelter</a>, where we ate grapes and roasted red pepper hummus,
among other things.

On the way back down, we followed an almost endless waterfall.  The rock
was so steep that someone had attached wooden steps in some places!  Along
for the fun were Ann Reckner, Cinday Stack, Leo O'Donnell,
Paula Kingsbury, and Joanne Burke.  Thanks to Leo for organizing!
