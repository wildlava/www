(Not shown are the 33" spare (which fits nicely and snugly
after raising the center brake light) and the brand-new soft top.
Also, it now has a new soft top - great to have clear windows again!)

Yep, I got this baby during summer of 1996, and it's been a blast!  It's a 1997
Jeep Wrangler "TJ" Sport (this just means it's got the 4.0L I6 engine
and other cool stuff).
In the picture to the right, I had just driven it from the dealer,
and it still had the silly "Sport" decal (look above the word "Jeep"),
which came off the very same weekend.  It also had factory
Goodyear Wrangler GSA tires in the 225/75R15 size.

The pictures below are when I was trying out some new wheels
(Mickey Thompson Classics).
I didn't like these wheels,
however, since they stuck out past the fender flares
a little too far for my tastes.
They were nice looking wheels though:

People who work with me like to be playful with my Jeep.  Here several wise
crackers have "trapped" me with their cars (These pics were taken while the
jeep was still mostly "stock").  What fun!!!
