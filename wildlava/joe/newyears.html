Black Tie?  Who's suggestion was that?  This New Years was definitely a blast!
We did dinner at the Cottonwood Cafe in Cambridge, then headed over to the
Charles Hotel for the festivities.  There was basically one somewhat lame
band and one pretty cool swing band.  Well, the pics tell the story...

At the Cottenwood Cafe: Jim, Pam, Andy, Olaf, Chris, Joanne, Joe, and Heather.
Oh, and Civie's <i>white</i> sleeve on the left and Rob's <i>black</i> sleeve
on the right.  There's no trace of Joan's clothing here at all...

I hear that Chris Civie bought
his tux at Building 19.  Way cool, but everyone had to re-adjust their camera
exposures.  Here Civie is giving us a lesson on how to offend Joan.  It worked.

Hey Rob, is it true that Heather had grill marks on her face for a week
from the flash?

"Hey, I have Olaf's wallet.  Let's see what he's got in here - wow, it's
a Probe card and a Yamabuki #2!"

Everyone wanted to hold a piece of mail I guess.  What better to do in
my lobby?  Unfortunately, we did not have time for a toast at my place
now.  It would have to wait until later...

That's Lew, Dave, and Jim, with whom we met up at the Charles Hotel.
I think they opened an auto parts store in the 70s.

Civie and I were spending a great deal of time trying to capture the
essense of Rox.
