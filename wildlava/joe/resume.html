<a href="http://www.wildlava.com/">
Wild Lava, LLC</a>
(2001 - present)</H4>
As <i>Owner</i>:

<ul>
<li>
Design and development of Android mobile phone/tablet apps, including "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wildlava.skydivingformations">Skydiving Formations</a>",
a tool for skydiving organizers/instructors.  Also, computer network and IT
consulting for businesses.
</ul>

<H4>
<a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/">
Southwest Research Institute</a>
(August 2001 - present)</H4>
As <i>Space Operations Lead</i>:

<ul>
<li>
  <i>For New Horizons Mission to Pluto (arrival: July 14, 2015):</i>
  <p>
  Leading a team responsible for processing data returned by the unmanned spacecraft on its way to Pluto (for science as well as optical navigation and hazard detection). Developed an automated ground-based science data pipeline used for calibration and long-term archiving (with NASA) of data returned to Earth. Project requires collaboration with many science and spacecraft instrument teams as well as the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (mission operations and spacecraft designer).

<li>
  <i>For Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover (currently on Mars):</i>
  <p>

  Member of the science operations team for the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the rover, which collects particle data for science purposes and to help determine potential astronaut radiation hazards on the surface of Mars. Developed calibration data pipeline for RAD and also responsible for archiving data with NASA.

<li>
  <i>For Space Operations computer network:</i>
  <p>

  Architect of the department's computing facility used for storing, processing, and serving science data for various missions. Key aspects are internet connectivity (including IPv6 for future-proofing), network security, and virtual machine deployment for services (Web/HTTP, email/SMTP, software licensing, DNS, etc.).

<li>
  <i>As Section Manager:</i>
  <p>

  Manager of the Space Operations section, a talented group of engineers, analysts, and scientists who are responsible for planning/sequencing the commands that control unmanned spacecraft and processing the data returned to Earth.
</ul>

As <i>Network and Software Architect (Cassini, Mission to Saturn)</i>:
<ul>

<li>
Developed a new web-based interface to our in-house Saturn observation
planning SQL database.  This was new development in PHP for the
purpose of automating and managing various complex science planning
tasks and replacing an old spreadsheet-based system of database update.
This system has to interface to a database at JPL in order to keep
data records in sync with our enhanced database.
<li>
Responsible for the ongoing design and management of the computer network
for Cassini Imaging Science.  Re-implemented various parts of the
infrastructure, including a new T1 connection and Cisco router, DNS
email, new Linux workstations and servers, NFS and Samba file sharing,
in-house web pages, backup system, RAID array for images, etc.
Transitioned vital information
from legacy VMS systems to a Linux, Tru64 Unix, and Windows environment.
<li>
In the initial planning stages of an image database and graphical front-end
to be used for the 300,000-400,000 images to be returned during the
tour of Saturn.  Initial plans call for the server-side to use either
Java or PHP and the client-side to use Java to enable rich interaction and
complex (including spacial and geometric) queries.
</ul>

<H4>
<A HREF="http://www.simauthor.com/">SimAuthor, Inc.</A>
(March 2000 - May 2001)</H4>
As <I>Engineering Manager</I>:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Managed the engineering team, creating a development plan and schedule for
a release of FlightViz and saw this plan through to completion of the release.
</ul>
As <I>Senior Software Engineer</I>:&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
Developed system for capturing real-time flight data and video from Level D
Corporate Jet flight simulators at FlightSafety International
for use in debriefing student training flights.  This
involved writing two TCP/IP server applications (one for data and interfacing
to software on a Harris Nighthawk simulator host and one for video and
audio capture), both controlled via a separate TCP/IP link.  Also developed
Windows application to retrieve data/video sessions and launch FlightViz,
SimAuthor's flight data visualization system.
<li>
Helped to re-architect, using real-world coordinates (latitude, longitude,
and altitude), the way FlightViz deals with its three types of models: airplane
with trajectory, custom-built airport models, and automatically generated
airports.  Also added various graphics features to the GL subsystems, including
pan and zoom ability for instrument models.
<LI>
Improved the software build system to take it from a four page manual
procedure to a one-step process.  Initiated bug tracking using a new
install of Bugzilla and MySQL.
<LI>
As company network administrator,
 revamped the company's network to make services, such as email, more reliable.
Brought DNS and Web servers (for intranet) inside the company using a
Linux host.
</UL>

<H4>
<A HREF="http://www.synapix.com/">SynaPix, Inc.</A>
(November 1998 - February 2000)</H4>
As <I>Principal Engineer</I>:&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
Co-developed the new "Shape Modeler" for SynaFlex, a 3D special effects
and compositing system
for the TV and movie business.  Animation artists use the Modeler subsystem
to reconstruct 3D scene elements from live film or video footage.  My
responsibility is the user interface, allowing the display and manipulation
of shapes and their vertices in order to match them with real scene elements.
The corresponding 3D geometry is then mathematically
calculated using this 2D positional information and the camera's
path through space.
All code is written in Java and uses OpenGL for 3D rendering.
<LI>
Responsible for the "Virtual Theatre" in SynaFlex.  My main focus is
the design and implementation of 3D Interactors for manipulating objects,
cameras, and lights in a scene.  The Virtual Theatre
is the main staging area for the
creation of special effects using 3D computer graphics combined with
texture-mapped depth extracted from the original live footage
(using either the Modeler described
above or an automated depth and camera-path extractor).
