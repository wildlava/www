    Conceptualizing remote Mission Operations, including secure remote commanding of space assets and display of real-time telemetry, using mobile technology (Android).
<li>
  <i>For New Horizons Mission to Pluto (flyby: July 14, 2015):</i>
  <p>
    Leading the team responsible for processing data from the Pluto spacecraft. Migrated to Agile development process and git source control for all software. Developed an object-oriented science data pipeline for production, calibration, and long-term NASA archiving of data returned to Earth. Requires collaboration with numerous science, operations, and spacecraft teams.
<li>
  <i>For Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover (currently on Mars):</i>
  <p>
    Performing science operations for the radiation detector on the rover. Developed calibration/archiving pipeline for this instrument.
<li>
  <i>For Space Operations computer network:</i>
  <p>
    Architecture of the department's computing facility used for storing, processing, and serving science data for various missions. Key aspects are Internet connectivity (including IPv6 for future-proofing), network security, DNS, web/HTTP, email/SMTP, software licensing, backups, etc. Virtual machine deployment used for services where appropriate.
<li>
  <i>As Section Manager:</i>
  <p>
    Managing the group of Space Operations personnel in our department.
</ul>
As <i>Network and Software Architect (Cassini, Mission to Saturn)</i>:
<ul>
<li>Developed a new web/SQL-based application for Saturn observation planning.
<li>Revamped the network infrastructure, including a new Internet connection and Cisco router, DNS, email, new Linux workstations and servers, NFS and Samba file sharing, web server, backup system, RAID array, etc.
<li>Designed an image database and graphical front-end to be used for the 300,000-400,000 planned images during the exploration of Saturn.
</ul>

<b>Wild Lava, LLC (2001 - present)</b>
<p>
As <i>Founder | Android Application Designer</i>:
<ul>
<li>Design and development of Android mobile phone/tablet apps, including "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wildlava.skydivingformations">Skydiving Formations</a>", a tool for skydiving organizers/instructors.
<li>Computer network and IT consulting for businesses.
</ul>

<b>SimAuthor, Inc. (2000 - 2001)</b>
<p>
As <i>Engineering Manager</i>:
<ul>
<li>Managed the engineering team, creating a development plan and schedule for a release of FlightViz, which was executed on-time and on-budget.
</ul>
As <i>Senior Software Engineer</i>:
<ul>
<li>Developed system for capturing and replaying real-time flight data and video from "Level D" corporate jet flight simulators at FlightSafety International.
<li>Added real-world coordinates and pan and zoom capability for instruments to FlightViz's rendering of 3D models with OpenGL.
<li>Improved the software build system to transition from a four page manual procedure to a one-step process.
</ul>
As <i>Network Architect</i>:
<ul>
<li>Revamped the network to greatly increase reliability of services.
</ul>

<b>SynaPix, Inc. (1998 - 2000)</b>
<p>
As <i>Principal Engineer</i>:
<ul>
<li>Developed the user interface for the "Shape Modeler" in SynaFlex, a 3D special effects and compositing system for TV and motion pictures. It allows the creation of shapes that correspond to real scene elements in live film or video footage. This enables efficient integration of CGI elements into the scene. All code was written in Java, using OpenGL for 3D rendering.
<li>Designed 3D interactors for manipulating objects, cameras, and lights for the "Virtual Theatre" in SynaFlex, a system in which depth is extracted from original live footage using camera path and scene image analysis.
</ul>

<b>Advanced Visual Systems Inc. (1996 - 1998)</b>
<p>
As <i>Senior Systems Engineer</i>:
<ul>
<li>Provided technical pre-sales support for AVS/Express, our flagship data visualization development environment. This provided not only technical experience from an end-user application development perspective but also provided experience working with customers and with the sales process.
</ul>

<b>WSI Corporation (1994 - 1996)</b>
<p>
As <i>Senior Software Engineer</i>:
<ul>
<li>Designed and developed ShowFX, a next generation 3D weather special effects system for TV weather that allows meteorologists to animate 3D special effects, such as flying 3D text, animated icons, 3D fronts, flowing jet streams, terrain elevation data, and cloud imagery.
<li>Implemented 3D graphic elements, such as lit and shaded text, beveled polygons, and weather fronts in the Weather Producer (software used by media/TV weather shows) using SGI's Open Inventor 3D library (a high-level scene graph API based on OpenGL).
<li>Involved in early development of the <a href="http://www.intellicast.com/">Intellicast</a> public weather web site.
</ul>

<b>Advanced Visual Systems Inc. (1990 - 1994)</b>
<br>
<i>(formerly Stardent Computer and Stellar Computer)</i>
<p>
As <i>Software Engineer</i>:
<ul>
<li>Designed architecture of low-level 3D layer in AVS/Express, which is used to graphically visualize large multi-dimensional datasets for better insight and understanding in disciplines such as medical, environmental, geospatial, and financial.
<li>Implemented native spheres, 2D and 3D texture mapping, and volume rendering in the software renderer. Ported 3D graphics rendering to SGI and IBM workstations using GL (later: OpenGL).
<li>Acted as company-wide network architect, including Internet services such as web, email and DNS.
