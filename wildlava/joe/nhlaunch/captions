New Horizons Launch - January 14-19, 2006;In January of 2006, many of those who worked on the New Horizons Mission to Pluto (plus their family and friends) gathered at Cape Canaveral, Florida to witness the spacecraft's long-anticipated launch.  Many events and fun outings served to build the excitement as launch day approached, and the drama that unfolded during the three days of attempts were only topped by the launch itself and the successful start of New Horizons' voyage.  These pictures document one point of view during this great week - plus it was my first launch!
On "Launch minus 3 days" (which turned out to be "Launch minus 5 days"), we attended the New Horizons Science Team Meeting.
...
Several question and answer sessions were held at the Kennedy Space Center's visitor complex.  Here, Will describes the spacecraft and its parts, while Jeff and Andrew field questions from the audience.
...
...
And then we spent some time in the visitor complex, admiring the "rocket garden," where life-sized models of vehicles from past years were on display.
...
...
The "Mercury Redstone" rocket, which we saw later on its actual launch pad, was the first rocket to send a human into space.

Back to Redstone

Bill tries out the Mercury capsule and looks quite comfy.
"If you're not going to light this candle, I'm outta here!"
Bill, Dave, Andrew, and I took a self-guided tour of the KSC grounds, visiting old, abandoned launch pads.  Our official but temporary badges let us do this unescorted, and it was quite an experience.  Dave and Bill provided quite a history lesson as we drove from pad to pad, going in reverse chronological order.  First stop was Apollo 1, and here we see the "buckets" used to deflect the exhaust to the sides.
The launch platform of Apollo 1, site of the tragic capsule fire that took the lives of several astronauts, stands in ruin.
Looking up from under the launch platform, we see the ring-shaped pipe that dumped water before launch to dampen the sound.
This plaque commemorates the tragedy.
To get an idea of scale, Bill volunteers to stand beside the instructions to "abandon in place."
Looking under the exhaust bucket
The inside of this bucket still shows the scars of rocket exhaust.
At the block house for Apollo 1, we find that they did not kid around when building blast doors!
Placards like this still hang, frozen in time.
Dave leads the way to the roof of the block house.
From the top, we can see the cable tray leading out to the pad.
Joe (that's me!), Bill, Dave, and Andrew pose on the block house.
Other more active pads can be seen pretty well from up here!
...
This periscope was used to view the launch from safely inside.
Now on the the Gemini site.  This one had an amazing ruin of the rocket gantry, or at least part of it, in the lowered (horizontal) position.
Not sure what this was about (inside the structure below the gantry), as it was placarded recently - ongoing studies?
More ruins - there were even some old "curtains" with fabric still intact but showing its age.  A couple of light bulbs also remain in their sockets.  Do they still work?
A tunnel through the structure below
The launch platform itself sat above the old "bucket" chute, all crumbling from rust at this point.
Old parts in the rubble
One can imagine flames shooting out of this opening back in the day!
The gantry, to the upper right, would lift to a vertical position to allow access to the rocket.
Here's where the Gemini rocket sat.
These two birds seemed to be guarding this part of history.
The gantry again
Now, atop the block house, we get a nice view of the whole launch pad.
...
...
On to the Mercury pad, looking back at its block house
This rusted pipe lies beneath part of the launch area - exhaust redirect?
...
The Mercury pad shows old flame scars as well.
...
These channels must have been used to catch the water.
Bleachers - surely a bit too close!
Hmm, how many times did this number get called?
The long ramp up to the Mercury pad
A look around the back
Bill pretends to mess with the switches - haha!
How long will these ruins remain?
As we leave the Mercury pad, we see some historic parking spaces!
The monument at the entrance
...
We catch a wonderful sunset just before finishing our tour.
...
As darkness looms, we arrive at the Redstone rocket pad, where another model stands on the spot where these early flights were launched..
As can be seen, the "bucket" is pretty small for this diminutive rocket!
That capsule would give anyone claustrophobia!
...
The science team and many others march up the hill to the "roll out," in which the New Horizons launch vehicle will be slowly rolled at about one mile-per-hour from the integration building to the launch pad.
At this point, it's still inside the building on the left.
And then it emerges!
...
...
...
The occasional interview takes place from the press members, who were sectioned off from us with cones and rope.
And at last New Horizons, atop the Atlas rocket, is on its pad, surrounded by tall lightning rods!
I pose with the rocket.
One last look before we get closer
We were lucky enough to get really close to the pad and see the vehicle up close.
...
Zoomed in on the nose of the rocket, where New Horizons waits patiently.
No, the rocket is not leaning, and neither am I!
Bill and Dave with the rocket
The rocket and Dave
Jeanette and the rocket
Okay, now just the rocket
A closeup of the lightning tower, with cool clouds as a backdrop
OK, more cool clouds!

The day before the first launch attempt, we drove to the press viewing site.  The giant countdown clock is to the right of the flag, and the spacecraft is off in the distance on the right.
We also drove to the nearby Banana Creek viewing site.
Zoomed in on New Horizons from Banana Creek.
And zoomed in at the press site.
That giant clock was a kick!  It looks like a hodgepodge of light bulbs came together for the cause!
...
The enormous Vehicle Assembly Building (used for the space shuttle) seen from the press site.
On the day of the first launch attempt, the official NASA Snack Mobile offered us a great selection of treats!
Inside the press site, NASA TV was piped to monitors, and countdown clocks were everywhere.
Members of the science team were on hand to field questions at the press site, but alas, winds caused a scrub the first day.  The drama was high, however, even including a last-minute resumption of the countdown, only to be stopped minutes before launch by an untimely gust.
Now, two days later, we are more hopeful, as the liquid oxygen being loaded into the rocket adds a frosty white finish to the gleaming copper.
Only minutes to go!  Or so we thought...  An iffy cloud cover held launch for almost an hour past the scheduled time, but this only added to the excitement!
And liftoff!  (This and the following series of pictures were taken rapid-fire while I held the shutter button and admired the spectacle!  Stunned at what I was seeing, I did take my finger off the button for a while and missed part of the ascent.)
