<hr><br>

Sleek and silent
<br>
A whispy and delicate essence
<br>
That takes shape without effort
<br>
And becomes all that embodies
<br>
What is feminine

<p><hr><br>

Voices in the distance slowly silencing
<br>
Clouds parting and taking the rain with them
<br>
Warmth growing from within and without

<p>

Water soothing thoughts of chill
<br>
Skin without cover taking in the moment
<br>
Overwhelmed by the perfection

<p>

Touched only by each other
<br>
Sensation beyond comprehension
<br>
This place is the world for now

<p><hr><br>

The darkness is upon us
<br>
The last light is gone
<br>
Lava glow is luminous       
<br>
No sunlight until dawn

<p><hr><br>

Each glance builds the passion
<br>
A simple touch sustains us
<br>
Under control for now
<br>
It will wait

<p>

Time to let go
<br>
Let it take us away
<br>
Passion's script evolving before us
<br>
Willing captives in its grip

<p>

Where is the line between us?
<br>
It is melting away
<br>
Passion does not divide us
<br>
It makes us one

<p><hr><br>

As if supported from below
<br>
The majesty creeps downward
<br>
Forever in freefall
<br>
To meet its pedestal

<p>

Transported to the brink
<br>
Past lavish wooded banks
<br>
Where water meets air
<br>
And is released to the wind

<p>

How brief the solitude
<br>
Where once there was no break
<br>
Destined to rejoin the flow
<br>
Within a tumultuous mist

<p>

Bold fragile beauty
<br>
Ancient natural danger
<br>
Surviving through time
<br>
But destroyed by fear

<p><hr><br>

"Mere Points of Light"

<p>

A sparkle from the right
<br>
Edge of my vision
<br>
My gaze darts to it
<br>
It is steady, moving
<br>
The sharp light cuts the night
<br>
Brighter than any star or planet
<br>
Tracking, no cruising, the sky!

<p>

I cannot see them
<br>
The people
<br>
But they are there
<br>
Inside that point of light
<br>
Looking down at a globe
<br>
That thought alone is vast
<br>
And the speed, intense

<p>

The glimmer falters
<br>
They pass into shadow
<br>
A sunset for them
<br>
For me, the steady night
<br>
They are gone to me
<br>
The connection is lost

<p>

Deja vu, but no
<br>
For this one is dimmer
<br>
Another ship
<br>
In hot pursuit
<br>
It looks different
<br>
Even from here
<br>
I can almost feel them up there

<p><hr><br>

We hiked the Canyon
<br>
The last time I was there
<br>
Down and up in one day
<br>
I suppose it made me respect
<br>
It even more
<br>
The feeling of exhaustion was starting
<br>
To creep into our minds and bodies
<br>
When we reached the bottom
<br>
We tried to shove out the
<br>
Thought of the climb to come

<p>

The quick dip
<br>
In one of the Colorado's
<br>
Tributaries seemed like
<br>
Token refreshment
<br>
This small branch of the
<br>
Great river
<br>
Having carved its own
<br>
Awesome canyon within

<p>

You see
<br>
There is a vital difference
<br>
Between climbing
<br>
Into a canyon and
<br>
Climbing a mountain
<br>
They are mirror images of each other
<br>
You always know the
<br>
Climb back up
<br>
Will be harder
<br>
That is an ominous thought

<p>

But we made it
<br>
Switchback after switchback
<br>
We saw rim within rim
<br>
Always thinking
<br>
Or maybe hoping
<br>
That the rim we could see was the top
<br>
But we really knew
<br>
Deep down
<br>
That it wasn't
<br>
It couldn't be

<p>

Dusk was approaching
<br>
As we gazed upon
<br>
The last rim
<br>
Bats flew overhead
<br>
We both knew we could make it but
<br>
Feared we may not be able to muster up
<br>
That last bit of strength
<br>
To go just one more switchback

<p>

Reaching he top seemed
<br>
Almost anticlimactic
<br>
The experience was one of
<br>
Loss of perspective
<br>
Being in the canyon is a little like
<br>
Being a rat in a maze
<br>
You lose the whole picture
<br>
But you do feel a part of it
<br>
It seems more real

<p><hr><br>

Light as air
<br>
You dance upon my psyche
<br>
With tentative grace
<br>
Releasing feelings into me

<p>

Full of life
<br>
You glow from inside
<br>
Radiant beyond compare
<br>
Enveloping me with your warmth

<p>

Modestly natural
<br>
Your herbal hair brushes me
<br>
With scent of earthy spice
<br>
Numbing me with deep serenity

<p>

Unimaginably sensual
<br>
You ignite my passion
<br>
Like a rising storm
<br>
Absorbing my fire with yours

<p>

Mysteriously woeful
<br>
I want to delve deeper
<br>
Inside what you are
<br>
Drawing your realness closer

<p>

Painfully relaxed
<br>
I lie on the edge of a blade
<br>
In willful anguish
<br>
Because you are there too

<p>

Quietly tormented
<br>
You drop your eyes away
<br>
So dark and deep
<br>
Protecting your soul from my gaze

<p>

Unwillingly torn
<br>
You fear the flame
<br>
Which can never burn you
<br>
Drifting away to cooler waters

<p>

Etherial as a cloud
<br>
You tremble with uncertainty
<br>
Hardly there at all
<br>
Falling through my outstretched fingers

<p><hr><br>

The day hits like a wall of cotton
<br>
Soaked in warm brine
<br>
I push through the streets
<br>
Kept unclean by the blistering heat

<p>

The door revolves around me
<br>
As I anticipate the flash of cold
<br>
And hold my breath to meet the change
<br>
Both painful and delicious

<p>

Night falls bringing only darkness
<br>
A dark heat with the frigid flow of
<br>
Cool washing over legs as we pass
<br>
The beckoning doorways on Bourbon Street

<p>

Beers and Hurricanes to go
<br>
Blues echoing from gritty rooms
<br>
Burlesque salesmen touting their jewels
<br>
And uninhibited stumbling souls

<p>

As the Bayou recedes into intricate
<br>
Tendrils of life teaming soup
<br>
The heat becomes a permanent memory
<br>
And the voodoo charm makes me promise to return

<p><hr><br>

Chomping on coffee beans
<br>
In a well-lit room
<br>
With Posters of lightning bolts
<br>
As they prepare your tomb

<p>

Is nothing like Jae's
<br>
Where the gin is Bombay
<br>
And the Sushi is scrumptious
<br>
After a long day

<p><hr><br>

I sit and glaze over as
<br>
The words dribble out
<br>
Empty and stale
<br>
Stinking of deception and
<br>
Money Hungry, Coin Operated
<br>
Junkies

<p>

It's the end of the Quarter
<br>
And the withdrawl is ugly
<br>
All that matters are the Numbers
<br>
Begging and stealing they
<br>
Suck the vein dry on that
<br>
Last hapless hopeful client

<p>

I hide in technology
<br>
Trying to find my blinders
<br>
I hear the gleam in their Eyes
<br>
It sickens and excites
<br>
It depresses and uplifts
<br>
Madness

<p><hr><br>

Just a typical day, yes
<br>
But it starts so innocent
<br>
Cool breeze wafting through
<br>
The Jeep's vinyl flapping

<p>

The highway is straight
<br>
A direct line to the fire
<br>
But the cup of Joe calms
<br>
I settle in

<p>

Time is sucking away
<br>
So hard to meet minds
<br>
In a 3000 mile triangle
<br>
Status demanded but unfulfilling

<p>

Serious man breaths
<br>
Down my neck as I scramble
<br>
To make the machine sing
<br>
It laughs at me

<p>

But there's the sunset
<br>
Growing my world
<br>
Washing time behind it
<br>
I dive in
