<i>
A martini demands a particular glass<br>
No simple vessel is up to the task<br>
The walls of the receptacle must be thin<br>
As if the air around were supporting the gin<br>
<p>
The garnish should be olives - three or four<br>
Or I suggest you show the bartender the door<br>
No need for a toothpick to skewer the flesh<br>
but indeed, those olives had better be fresh<br>
<p>
Vermouth is a good thing - don't skimp on it here<br>
Some wet the glass and then let it drip clear<br>
But don't overdo it with that precious wine<br>
Just a quick spash will make it sublime<br>
<p>
Most important of all is the chill of that glass<br>
And the cold in that mixture so the cool taste will last<br>
Shaken or stirred?  Who cares in the end?<br>
What you raise to your lips is a mighty fine blend!<br>
