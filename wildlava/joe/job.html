I currently work at
<a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/">Southwest Research Institute</a>
as the manager of missions operations.  We work on planetary
space missions, and the one that is currently taking most of my time is
<a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/">New Horizons</a>,
which is on its way to Pluto.  The spacecraft
will fly by Jupiter at the end of February of 2007, and it will reach
Pluto in 2015!
