<h2>
Skydive!
</h2>
I've been skydiving for about 16 years.  Many people ask why I would
do such a thing.  Well, there's a simple answer: it's a lot of fun!
It's also one of the most challenging things I've ever done, and
the learning never stops.
<p>
My license number is D-13839, and I have over 1300 jumps.
I started jumping at the Massachusetts Sport Parachute Club (MSPC)
in Turners Falls, MA.  It was a special place with special people, and
I have fond memories (I even met my wife there!).
I jumped regularly at drop zones around New England,
especially <a href="http://www.jumptown.com/">Orange (Jumptown)</a>
(which is the Turners Falls DZ transplanted),
<a href="http://www.skyjump.com/">Pepperell</a>,
and <a href="http://www.skydivenewengland.com/">Lebanon</a>.
<p>
We live close to <a href="http://www.skyrush.com/boulder/">Boulder, Colorado</a>
now.  Colorado was in need of a skydiving forum for the skydivers here to
share ideas, announce events, and talk about the skydiving culture in
the state, so I created one.  If you skydive in
Colorado, please feel free to join in.

I am also a <a href="/flying/">pilot</a>, which is
very different.  A great quote comparing skydiving and flying airplanes is:
<i>"If riding in an airplane is flying,
then riding in a boat is swimming..."</i>
In other words, skydiving is flying your <i>body</i>!  I love flying in all
of its forms, though!

These pictures are from a jump we did during 20-way practice.
In the one on the left,
Ira (the camera dude) got directly above us and framed Pepperell
<a href="bz_geek.jpg"><img src="bz_geek_small.gif" align=right></a>
Skydiving Center nicely!  That's me at the very top of the picture.
The picture to the right is earlier on the same dive.
The object was pretty much just to geek the camera.

Joanne and I got these pictures taken by Ira on July 12, 1998,
exactly two weeks before we got married!

We're especially proud of the "no hands kiss pass!"

Hey, we broke another New England record for most skydivers in a freefall
formation!
It was 76 people big, and we did it on August 23, 1997.  The image to the
<a href="76way.jpg"><img src="76way_small.gif" align=right></a>
left shows the 3 planes that were flying together with all of the skydivers
pouring out - pretty awesome sight!  However, I was in the plane on the
right, so I didn't exactly get this view.  The picture on the right is the
completed formation.  We held it for about 8 seconds after completion!
Thanks to Ira Gray for getting these awesome pictures!

<a href="54way.jpg"><img src="54way_small.gif" align=left></a>
The last record was a 54-way on Sunday, May 21st, 1995.
Click on the little picture to the
left to see the completed formation.
Can you find me?  If not, or if you
want to see who all of the other people are, check out the
<a href="54diagram_no_photo.html">diagram</a> of the dive.
If you want to see the
photo at the same time here's the <a href="54diagram.html">
diagram with photo</a>.  Check out the
video section below to see the dive in action!
Amongst the jubilation we posed for
a <a href="54group.jpg">group photo</a>.
And yep, they made some
<a href="54_cert.jpg">certificates</a>!
The photos were taken by Robert Glenn, who flew in from Virginia
with the Casa airplane
(shown in the group photo) for the weekend.

<a href="sky.jpg"><img src="sky_small.gif" align=right></a>
The picture to the right was taken in freefall over
Zephyrhills, Florida in January, 1991.
I'm on the left, and the other dude is Mark Hood.  He lives out in the
Bay Area (California) now.
The picture was taken by Hiroto Shibuya with a disposable camera!
<a href="hmj.jpg">Here we are eating</a>
between jumps in Coolidge, Arizona a year earlier (see the balloon jump
we did in the video section below).
Hiroto and I made our first jump on the same day: August 5th, 1989.
<a href="jump1.jpg">This is me</a>
under canopy on my first jump under a big old honker of a canopy!
And of course I got
a <a href="certif.jpg">
First Jump Certificate</a>!

Here are some of my skydiving videos:
</h2>

<a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/54way_video.mpg"><img align=left src="54way_video.gif"></a>
(1.8MB) <b>The 54-way New England Record Dive!</b>  Here it is for your
viewing pleasure.  We broke the current record on May 21st, 1995 at
Pepperell, Massachusetts.  There's a cool <a href="54way.jpg">still shot</a>
of it too.
<br clear=left>
<p>
<a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/30way.mpg"><img align=right src="30way_large.gif"></a>
(604KB) A cool 30-way sequential "room" skydive we did.
It was done from a Twin Otter and two Cessnas.
Roger Ponce de Leon organized this one, which took place at
Pepperell on May 29th, 1994.
You can also see the <a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/30way_large.mpg">same dive at
double the resolution</a>
(2.8MB) (That's the size of the still on the right.
There's more climb-out footage
in this version, so you'll see a shot of the Cessna flying in formation!  But
I think the quality is better in the small one).
<br clear=right>
<p>
<a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/28way.mpg"><img align=left src="28way.gif"></a>
(586KB) This 28-way sequential skydive was pretty cool, since we
turned two 14-way pieces!
This was also organized by Roger Ponce at Pepperell,
and happened in the summer of 1993.

<a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/dive.mpg"><img align=left src="dive.gif"></a>
(862KB) Here's the silly skydive that followed with video
taken from within the formation.
This took place at Lebanon, ME in the summer of 1993.

<a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/balloon.mpg"><img align=right src="balloon.gif"></a>
(175KB) Some hot air balloon action over Arizona in January of 1990!
That was jump number 60 for me!  Wow - a long time ago...

<a href="http://skyrush.freeshell.org/skyrush/skydive/movies/german_nude_jump.mpg"><img align=left src="german_nude_jump.gif"></a>
(4MB) This video has been flying around the Net.  It's pretty funny.
Is this guy having too much fun to feel the pain?  I bet he was a little
"swollen" later...
