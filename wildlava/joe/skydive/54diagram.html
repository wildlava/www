Below is a diagram of the dive.  It's sort of a legend or roadmap showing
who everyone is on the dive and where their slots were.  Note that
the photo and the diagram are not from quite the same angle.  The
lobe on the left of the diagram (my quadrant), for example, is in the
upper left of the photo.
