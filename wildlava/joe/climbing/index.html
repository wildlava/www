Rock Climbing
</h2>

In Boulder, Colorado, it's a natural to get into
Rock Climbing.  I mean, <i>everyone</i> does it here!  I haven't done
as much outside climbing as I want to, but I'm sure that will change soon.
Joanne and I did the famous Third Flatiron with Lew and Lein
from back East shortly after we moved here.

Henry, Fathi, and I did Calypso on the Wind Tower in Eldorado Canyon
on July 14, 2002.  (pictures soon to come)

These pictures are from when I first tried rock climbing in the summer of 1995,
and it was a really interesting experience.  We were in Quincy Quarry near
Boston, MA.
This picture is me on a 75 foot rock face with quite a few small
hand and foot holds.  The guy belaying me is Lew Miller.

Even though the rope is always ready to catch you, there is nothing like
the feeling that you know you can't hold on much longer and you just
can't find that next foot placement!  It's really quite mental, and I'd
like to do more of it!

For fitness and just getting better at technical climbing in general, I'm
trying to make a habbit of going to the rock gym.  Here are some pictures
from one in Denver called "Paradise Rock Gym" taken in late 1999:

Now (start of 2002) I'm getting back into the swing of it with
some people from work.
