White water!

I really only did this once, and it was pretty fun, but it was really more
like an amusement park ride.  It never got <i>really</i> treacherous, although
one woman did fall out of one of the other rafts and got swept downstream
into some rocks - good thing for helmets!  That's me in the front left of the
raft (in the foreground of the picture).  Are we having fun yet?
Clockwise from me are
<a href="http://hotspur.counterpoint.com/~lew/">Lew Miller</a>,
Phil Lynch, Hiroto Shibuya, "Saint Phil"
the guide, Dave Chapple, and Peter Kimber.  This trip was part
of a work outing from Applicon in the summer of 1989.
